# The Problem

## AI Detection Crisis

- **30-40%** false positive rate in AI detectors
- **90%+** universities now require AI disclosure
- **72%** of students report anxiety about AI detection
- **500%** increase in academic disputes since ChatGPT

## Students Have No Defense

- Accused of AI-generated work with no way to prove innocence
- Current AI detectors are fundamentally unreliable
- Honor statements are unverifiable
- Google Docs version history can be manipulated

# Our Solution

## Forensic Proof of Authorship

**Sovereignty Shield** = A "flight recorder" for writing

### Core Concept
- Capture every keystroke, every edit, every save
- Create tamper-resistant forensic evidence
- Shift from "prove you didn't cheat" to "here is proof I wrote this"

### Key Technologies
- Keystroke Telemetry (typing patterns)
- Cryptographic Hash Chains (SHA-256)
- PDF Attestation Certificates
- Real-time Draft Snapshots
