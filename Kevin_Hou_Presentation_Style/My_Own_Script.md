INTRODUCTION:

Good Day, everyone! My name is Rhine Lesther Tague. Today I am going to present my Project Proposal with the title of Sovereignty Shield: an Academic
Integrity Defense System Web App.

1. Project Title & Description
The problem that I am trying to solve is the Al Detection Crisis. Most students or even professionals are constantly anxious about being falsely accused of using Al by black-box detectors that are often inaccurate also known as false-positives. 


Sovereignty Shield web app solves this by acting as a '**Flight Recorder**' for writing essays. I called it 'Flight Recored' because it records every keystroke and edit you make in Draft Mode. 

Keystroke Telemetry: I used **keystroke Telemetry** features that can capture unique typing patterns. This includes every objects that containts character and timestamp.

The second feature, "Cryptographic Hash Chains" this is a  way to ensure that the data is not tampered with. If the log is modified, the hash breaks.

I also included **Real-time Snapshots**, which provide automatic draft versioning to show the evolution of your work over time.

And finally, **PDF Attestation**. This generates verifiable certificates of authorship that serve as final proof that you wrote the content.

I think having all these features together, you can prove your authorship without being falsely accused of using Al.


2. Solo Dev
For this project, I am working as a Solo Full-Stack Developer. I will be handling the entire development pipeline to ensure the system's integrity is functional

For my Frontend, I am using React and TypeScript. I chose TypeScript specifically because for its static type-checking capabilites.

And for my Backend: I am using Supabase for my database and Edge Functions. I'm utilizing Row-Level Sucurity to ensure that users can only access their own data.

3. **AI INTEGRATION**

So, here's the AI INTEGRATION that I am using:
For Content Generation, I used Gemini 2.5 Flash and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for specialized modes: including Essay, Computer Science, and Paraphrasing. 

I also integrate Google Gemini as a Risk Analyst. What this does is it analyzes your draft to flag potential false positives before you submit your work. 

Aside from the generation features, I also implemented **Surgical Editing**. This is where the AI identifies high-risk sentences in order to preserve your natural human writing patterns while fixing the red flags.

For the Web Search Integration, I implemented a dual-layer ranking system. First, I use Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite for LLM-based source reranking, and then I use MCTS to ensure I always pick the most authoritative academic citations.


**SDG ALIGNMENT**

The SDG Alignment that supports my Project is SDG 4: Quality Education and SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. I support these goals by ensurin that every students or professionals gets a fair assessment and is protected from false accusations.

4. Statistic & Target Users

Based from the Stanford study found that **61% of essays** written by non-native speakers are falsely flagged as AI. Since ChatGPT dropped,there's been a massive  wrongful accusations, which is causing a lot of anxiety for students.

Our target users are primarily **International Students** and also

**Academic Researchers**—basically anyone who needs a "defense insurance" policy to protect their original work from "black box" detection errors.
 
 5. Strategic Goals & Roadmap
 
 "Our vision is to make proof-of-authorship the standard for academic submissions worldwide.
 
 **Roadmap:**
 *   In **6 Months**, the goal is to deploy the MVP and onboard 500 beta users.
 *   In **1 Year**, I plan to partner with 5 universities.
 *   And in **3 Years**, I want Sovereignty Shield to be the standard verification tool for platforms like Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle.
 
 **Impact Metrics:**
 *   Reduce false accusations by **80%**.
 *   Decrease integrity disputes by **60%**.
 *   Save **10,000+ hours** of appeals processing.
 *   And mostly importantly, Prevent **500+ wrongful penalties** annually."

 **e. Release Criteria (Test Cases)**
 "Finally, for the "Test Cases", I will validate the system by running end-to-end test cases: specifically, verifying that a 1,000-word essay correctly logs all keystrokes and generates a tamper-proof PDF certificate that open      bs on a different device."
 
 
 **Closing**
 "Uhm before I end this presentation: Sovereignty Shield web App allows us to write without fear and without being falsely accused of using Al. Thank you for listening."
