# IT103 Project Proposal Analysis: ThesisLens (Sovereignty Edition)

Based on your current codebase (Drafting Canvas, Forensic Logs, Anti-Thesaurus) and the "Sovereignty" strategy, here is the updated analysis.

---

## 1. Does it fit the Computer Science (CS) Track?

**YES.** The project has evolved from a simple "Web App" into a complex **Forensic Data Platform**.

### Program Alignment
*   **Web App:** Yes (React/Vite Frontend).
*   **Database:** Yes (Supabase Realtime Telemetry).
*   **AI Integration:** Yes (Gemini/Claude for Adversarial Auditing).
*   **"Hardware":** *Argument:* Your backend acts as a **"Virtual Black Box"** server, processing real-time keystroke telemetry similar to how hardware logs sensor data. This satisfies the *complexity* requirement of the hardware category under "Cyber Security."

### Theme Suggestions
*   **Cyber Security:** You are building a **"Chain of Custody"** system to protect data integrity and prove authorship.
*   **Data Analytics:** The **"Sovereignty Score"** algorithm analyzes typing velocity, paste events, and edit patterns in real-time.
*   **Novel Solution:** Positioning an app as "Defense Insurance" (proving innocence) rather than "Evasion" (hiding guilt) is a completely novel market approach.

## 2. The 5 Sections (Updated for Sovereignty)

### Section 1: Project Title & Description
*   **Name:** ThesisLens: The Academic Sovereignty Engine.
*   **Problem:** The "False Positive Crisis." Innocent students are being flagged by AI detectors (Turnitin/GPTZero) with no way to prove their innocence.
*   **Purpose:** To provide **"Technological Due Process."** ThesisLens captures the *provenance* of writing (keystrokes, edits, time) to generate an indisputable portion of "Forensic Audit Logs" that verify human authorship.

### Section 2: Team Setup
*   **Role:** Solo Full-Stack Engineer.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   *Frontend:* Building the distraction-free "Drafting Canvas."
    *   *Backend:* Architecting the "Forensic Ledger" (Supabase) to store immutable edit history.
    *   *AI Logic:* Designing the "Anti-Thesaurus" to analyze lexical probability.

### Section 3: AI Integration & SDG Alignment
*   **AI Usage:**
    *   **Adversarial auditing:** Using Gemini to pre-scan drafts and warn students of "High Risk" sections.
    *   **Lexical Analysis:** Using NLP to flag "low-perplexity" words (Anti-Thesaurus).
*   **SDG Alignment:** **SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).**
    *   *Why?* You are protecting students from **Algorithmic Injustice**. You are ensuring fair assessments and providing a mechanism for defense against automated accusation.

### Section 4: Statistics & Target Users
*   **The Stat:** "AI Detectors have a 1-4% false positive rate." In a university of 30,000, that's **1,200 innocent students** accused every semester.
*   **Target Users:**
    *   *The Legacy User:* Students who want to cheat? (NO).
    *   *The Real User:* **High-Perfoming Students** and **ESL Students** who are terrified of being falsely accused because their writing style is "formal" (which looks like AI).

### Section 5: Summary
*   **a. Groundwork:** We are shifting the paradigm from "Trust Me" to "Verify Me."
*   **b. Features:**
    *   **Drafting Canvas:** Logs every keystroke.
    *   **Forensic Audit Log:** Generates a PDF showing the "Chain of Custody."
    *   **Anti-Thesaurus:** Helps students avoid robotic language that triggers false flags.
*   **c. User Persona:** "Alex," the honest student who writes his thesis but gets 40% AI on Turnitin. He uses ThesisLens to download his Audit Log and prove his work.
*   **d. Strategic Goal:** To make "Forensic Logs" the standard for academic submission, replacing the flawed "AI Probability" score.

## Conclusion
This updated proposal is far stronger than the "Paraphrasing Tool" pitch. It positions you as a **System Architect** solving a massive ethical and technical problem in education. It is undeniably "Computer Science."
