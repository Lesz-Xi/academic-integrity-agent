# Changelog - v2.2 (Post-AI Audit Revision)

**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Version:** 2.2
**Previous Version:** 2.1

## 🚨 Critical Updates: AI Adversarial Audit Integration

This version incorporates the findings from an independent technical verification and adversarial audit performed by **K-Dense AI** (an automated scientific critique agent). The audit identified a critical conflation between "statistical conservation" and "thermodynamic impossibility," prompting major revisions to the paper's theoretical claims.

### 📝 Major Revisions
*   **Hypothesis Refinement:** Adjusted the core "Entropic Vise" claim. We no longer claim that low-entropy regions are "thermodynamically impossible" to mutate. Instead, we correctly characterize them as imposing a "severe thermodynamic fitness penalty" or "high barrier."
*   **New Section:** Added **Section 4: Limitations and Future Directions**.
    *   Explicitly discusses the distinction between Shannon entropy and free energy ($\Delta G$).
    *   Acknowledges clinical evidence of Enfuvirtide resistance mutations (e.g., V38A) in the HR1 region, which refutes the concept of a "frozen" protein domain.
    *   Proposes the **"Entropic Vise 2.0"** model, which allows for rare, high-cost escape pathways.
*   **Future Work:** Added a specific call for **Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS)** of the gp41 HR1 domain to experimentally map the fitness landscape and validate the computational findings.
*   **Language Clarifications:**
    *   Replaced "thermodynamically forbidden" with "thermodynamically constrained."
    *   Replaced "impossible" with "highly penalized."
    *   Clarified that statistical conservation is a *proxy* for thermodynamic stability, not a direct measure.

### ➕ Additions
*   **Supplementary Materials:**
    *   Added `K-Dense_Report.pdf`: The full computational audit report by K-Dense AI.
    *   Added `K-Dense_Certificate.pdf`: Technical Verification Certificate confirming mathematical accuracy and methodological soundness.
*   **Acknowledgments:** Explicitly acknowledged K-Dense AI for its role in the adversarial review process.

### 🐛 Fixes & Corrections
*   **Abstract:** Updated to reflect the nuanced understanding of resistance pathways.
*   **Figure 1 Caption:** Renamed to "Identification of the Thermodynamic Constraint in HIV-1 gp41 HR1" to be more precise.
*   **Conclusion:** Rewritten to emphasize the framework as a "theoretical proposal" pending experimental verification.
