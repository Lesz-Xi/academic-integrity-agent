# Sovereignty Shield (ThesisLens)

## Product Overview

**Sovereignty Shield** is an AI-powered academic writing assistant designed to help students prove authentic authorship through forensic-grade telemetry and verification.

### Mission Statement

> To pivot academic writing tools from "Evasion" (Cheating) to "Sovereignty" (Proof of Authorship). We build **Defense Insurance**, not generic generative AI.

### Core Value Proposition

1. **Forensic Telemetry** — Captures keystroke patterns, timestamps, and behavioral signals during drafting
2. **Proof of Authorship** — Generates verifiable attestation certificates for submitted work
3. **Defense Toolkit** — Provides documentation and evidence for academic integrity disputes
4. **Drafting Canvas** — Zero-distraction writing environment with real-time telemetry

### Target Users

- **University Students** — Undergraduate and graduate students producing academic papers
- **Researchers** — Academics requiring proof of original authorship
- **Institutions** — Universities seeking to reduce false positives in AI detection

### Competitive Differentiator

Unlike AI detection tools that create false accusations, Sovereignty Shield provides **evidence of authentic human writing** through continuous behavioral capture and cryptographic verification.
