# Protocol: Implementing Features as the Sovereign Architect

You asked: *"If I want to implement a new feature, do I just call these two files?"*

**Answer:** No. These files are your **Badge** and your **Gun**. You still have to do the **Work**.

Here is the exact workflow for implementing a new feature (e.g., "Google Docs Export") under the new regime:

## Phase 1: Authentication (The Badge)
1.  **Run Command:** `/trigger_sovereignty`
    *   *Why:* This forces the AI to drop the "Assistant" persona and load the "Forensic Architect" context from `GEMINI.md`.
    *   *Result:* The AI essentially clocks in as a Senior Engineer.

## Phase 2: Design (The Blueprint)
2.  **Request:** "Plan the Google Docs Export feature."
    *   *The Difference:* Instead of just writing code, the Sovereign Architect will ask:
        *   *"How do we prove this export wasn't tampered with?"*
        *   *"Do we need to cryptographically sign the metadata?"*
    *   *Output:* A detailed `implementation_plan.md`.

## Phase 3: Execution (The Build)
3.  **Request:** "Execute the plan."
    *   *The Difference:* The code written will be strict.
        *   **Frontend:** Will focus on "Zen Mode" (Distraction-free).
        *   **Backend:** Will focus on "Immutable Logs" (Supabase RLS).

## Summary
*   `GEMINI.md` = **Who we are** (Context).
*   `/trigger_sovereignty` = **Wake Up** (Activation).
*   You still need to **Drive** (Prompting for the specific feature).
