Answer each question with deep analysis, clear reasoning, and original explanations.Cite examples from your own design ideas, experiences, or real-world observations. Answers must be complete, logically structured, and insightful, demonstrating understanding of Intelligent Agents in IoT & Automation.

TechSolvers Inc. that develops intelligent agents for various applications, ranging from customer service chatbots to autonomous drones for logistics. The company has recently been tasked with designing an intelligent agent system for a smart city project. This system will manage urban infrastructure, optimize traffic flow, enhance public safety, and provide personalized services to residents. The agent system must operate autonomously, adapt to changing environments, and learn from interactions with the city and its residents.

Case Study Questions:
Design Considerations:
What are the primary considerations TechSolvers Inc. should take into account when designing an intelligent agent system for a smart city? Discuss the trade-offs between autonomy, adaptability, and reliability in the context of managing urban infrastructure. (2)
2.Agent Architecture:
Illustrate (Draw) and describe the possible architecture for the intelligent agent system. How would you integrate various components such as sensors, data processing units, decision-making algorithms, and actuators? Discuss how these components would work together to optimize traffic flow in real-time. (3)
3.Learning and Adaptation:
How should the intelligent agents be designed to learn and adapt to the city's changing conditions, such as seasonal traffic patterns or emergency situations? Explain the role of reinforcement learning in this context and propose a strategy for the agents to continuously improve their performance. (3)
4. Ethical and Security Concerns:
What ethical and security concerns should be addressed when deploying intelligent agents in a smart city? Discuss potential risks related to privacy, data security, and decision-making biases, and propose measures to mitigate these risks. (2)
