The research procedure for this study followed a systematic approach divided into sequential stages. This plan served as a guide for the researchers to conduct the study and analyze the collected data systematically.

Conceptualization and Literature Review. The study initiated with the identification of the research gap regarding the impact of cashless payments on student budgeting. To establish a theoretical foundation, the researchers reviewed global and local literature on digital finance and adopted the Financial Behavioral Theory by Barberis and Thaler (2003). This phase involved defining the research problem, specifically how the convenience of e-wallets might lead to impulsive financial behavior among students.

Instrument Development. The researchers formulated a quantitative survey questionnaire to measure e-wallet usage and budgeting habits. This instrument was adapted from a previous study by Shivranjani R. (2022) regarding online shopping preferences. To ensure the tool was relevant to the current study, approximately 30% of the original questions were modified to focus on e-wallet transaction frequency and daily expense tracking, while maintaining the use of a Likert scale and closed-ended questions for consistency.

Respondent Selection. A purposive sampling technique was employed to select the participants. The researchers focused on a target population of first-year college students enrolled in ENG024 at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao. Strict inclusion criteria were applied: respondents had to be active users of e-wallets (like GCash or Maya) and willing to participate. A total of 30 respondents were selected based on these criteria to ensure the data provided firsthand insights into student financial management.
Data Collection. Data for this study was collected through Google Forms, streamlining the process for the students. The approved questionnaire was distributed digitally during the second week of the study. Throughout this stage, the researchers strictly adhered to ethical considerations by providing informed consent forms and ensuring that all responses remained anonymous and confidential, protecting the students' privacy while gathering the necessary information.

Data Cleaning and Analysis. Following the administration of the survey and the collection of the targeted 30 responses, the data underwent a cleaning process to check for completeness and consistency. The researchers then utilized a quantitative descriptive analysis to interpret the data. This involved calculating descriptive statistics to quantify the frequency of e-wallet use and to identify common patterns in how students allocate their budgets for food, transportation, and school requirements.
