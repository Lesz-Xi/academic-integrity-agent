# Golden Set Test: Formal Professional
**Input:**
> "The proposed acquisition of the subsidiary leverages significant synergies in the supply chain vertical. Due diligence indicates that while immediate integration costs are substantial, the long-term amortization schedule suggests a favorable return on investment (ROI) within the fiscal quartiles projected. Shareholders are advised to consider the macroeconomic volatility that may impact short-term liquidity."

**Goal:**
Paraphrase this text while:
1. Maintaining the strict professional tone (No slang, no contractions).
2. Evading AI detection via natural structural variation.
3. Preserving all technical terms (synergies, amortization, linear liquidity).

**Expected Output:**
- Professional, polished, but structurally varied.
- NO "It's", "There's", "I think".
- NO "So basically", "Kind of".
