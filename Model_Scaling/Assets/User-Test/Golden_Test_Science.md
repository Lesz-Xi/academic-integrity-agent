# Golden Set Test: Hard Science (Neuroscience)
**Input:**
> "Synaptic plasticity remains the fundamental substrate of learning and memory formation. Long-term potentiation (LTP) involves the persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. Specifically, the influx of calcium ions through NMDA receptors triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways, ultimately leading to the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane."

**Goal:**
Paraphrase this text while:
1. PRESVING strict technical accuracy (NMDA, AMPA, LTP, Calcium ions).
2. Avoiding "dumbed down" language (e.g. do NOT say "brain cells talk to each other").
3. Changing the sentence structure naturally to evade detection.

**Instruction to Use:**
"Paraphrase this while maintaining maximum technical precision." (Or leave blank to test auto-detection)
