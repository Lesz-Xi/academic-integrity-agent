# Paraphrase "Golden Set" Test Cases

Use these inputs to verify that the "Storybook Effect" is eliminated. All outputs must preserve the academic tone and vocabulary.

## Test Case 1: Dense Theory (Philosophy/Psychology)
**Input:**
> "The mechanisms behind self-doubt reveal themselves not as simple hesitations, but as complex recursive loops where the subject interrogates their own competence. This internal scrutiny, while often maladaptive, serves a perverse protectory function by preempting external criticism. Cognitive dissonance plays a central role here, as the individual strives to reconcile their perceived potential with their current performance metrics."

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Retains "recursive loops", "maladaptive", "preempting", "Cognitive dissonance".
- [ ] No slang (e.g., "mess", "stuff", "weird loops").
- [ ] No "I think" or "We see" additions.

## Test Case 2: Hard Science (Biology/Neuroscience)
**Input:**
> "Synaptic plasticity remains the fundamental substrate of learning and memory formation. Long-term potentiation (LTP) involves the persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. Specifically, the influx of calcium ions through NMDA receptors triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways, ultimately leading to the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane."

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Retains "Synaptic plasticity", "substrate", "LTP", "NMDA receptors", "AMPA receptors".
- [ ] Passive/Objective voice maintained.
- [ ] No "basically", "tiny doors", "stuff happens".

## Test Case 3: Formal Professional (Business/Legal)
**Input:**
> "The proposed acquisition of the subsidiary leverages significant synergies in the supply chain vertical. Due diligence indicates that while immediate integration costs are substantial, the long-term amortization schedule suggests a favorable return on investment (ROI) within the fiscal quartiles projected. Shareholders are advised to consider the macroeconomic volatility that may impact short-term liquidity."

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Retains "synergies", "vertical", "Due diligence", "amortization", "liquidity".
- [ ] No contractions ("It's", "There's").
- [ ] No "Heads up", "Look", "Money talk".
