The connection linking social media activity and the psychological well-being of adolescents is now a critical focal point in current psychological inquiry. Research consistently reveals links between too much screen time and higher instances of depression, anxiety, and issues with sleep quality affecting teenagers. The precise ways these connections operate are still debated among scholars; they suggest several different explanatory models. These include models based on social comparison theory, the anxiety of missing out, and alterations to natural sleep cycles. Still, demonstrating true cause and effect presents notable methodological hurdles. It is exceedingly hard to design controlled studies focusing on technology consumption as it occurs in real-world environments.
