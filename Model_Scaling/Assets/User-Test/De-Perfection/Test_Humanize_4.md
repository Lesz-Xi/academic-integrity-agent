The link between how much teens use social media and their mental health is a hot topic now. Research consistently shows links between too much screen time and rising anxiety, depression, and bad sleep patterns in teenagers. What causes this association remains unclear. Researchers suggest different models for this, like how kids compare themselves to others, FOMO, or messed-up sleep schedules. Still, proving direct cause remains quite hard. Conducting controlled studies on real-world tech habits is very difficult. This presents a real hurdle. Causality is tough.
