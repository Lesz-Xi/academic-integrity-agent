The link connecting adolescent mental health outcomes with social media consumption has turned into a significant area of focus within contemporary psychological study. Empirical findings repeatedly suggest connections between high levels of screen engagement and elevated occurrences of anxiety, depressive symptoms, alongside disrupted sleep cycles in teenagers. The underlying processes behind these connections are still debated, however. Researchers commonly suggest several models to account for this phenomenon: social comparison dynamics, the persistent anxiety concerning missing out, and alterations to the body's natural internal timing mechanisms. Still, proving direct causation poses a notable methodological hurdle. It is exceptionally difficult to run controlled studies observing technology use as it naturally occurs in the real world.
