# CS Mode Test: Hash Table Collisions
**Prompt:**
"Write a technical explanation of how Hash Tables handle collisions. Compare Chaining vs. Open Addressing. Include a small Python code snippet showing a basic hash function. Write as a student explaining it to a peer."

**What to Look For in Output:**
1.  **Natural Voice:** "So, what happens when two keys hash to the same spot?" (Good) vs "Collision resolution is mandatory." (Bad)
2.  **Varied Structure:** Mix of short facts and longer explanations.
3.  **No Fibonacci:** No weird 1-word fragments forced at the end of sentences.
4.  **Code Block:** Should be present and ignored by the "Style" check.

**Instruction:**
Use **Mode B (CS)** in your tool.
