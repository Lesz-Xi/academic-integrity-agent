The escalating crisis of plastic pollution has intensified demands on academic institutions to pursue more sustainable packaging solutions. University canteens, in particular, face mounting pressure to minimize their dependence on single-use plastics—materials that significantly contribute to environmental degradation through both waste accumulation and carbon emissions during production (Solsona, 2024). For Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao specifically, the prospect of transitioning from conventional plastic food containers to compostable alternatives presents a complex web of considerations involving economic viability, operational feasibility, and long-term environmental impact.

This transition isn't simply a matter of swapping one material for another. The decision involves navigating substantial financial trade-offs, evaluating existing infrastructure capabilities, and understanding consumer acceptance patterns. Research suggests that while compostable options may offer eventual cost savings through reduced waste disposal expenses (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions often hesitate due to higher upfront material costs. Within the Mapúa MCM canteen context, these competing factors necessitate careful examination of whether potential long-term advantages can justify immediate financial and operational challenges.

Consumer behavior represents another crucial dimension. Studies indicate that sustainable materials like biodegradable packaging can promote environmental responsibility among users (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), yet the actual effectiveness of such initiatives hinges on student awareness and active participation. This creates tension between institutional sustainability goals and consumer expectations, where gaps between intention and actual practice may undermine transition efforts (Solsona, 2024).

Our research focuses on conducting a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of shifting from plastic to compostable packaging within the Mapúa MCM canteen, examining financial, environmental, and behavioral aspects of this change. As undergraduate researchers, we recognize this problem as both urgent and relevant, particularly in demonstrating how educational institutions can pioneer sustainable practices while addressing realistic implementation barriers and cost constraints.

International evidence reveals mixed outcomes regarding compostable packaging adoption in university food services. The Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that compostable food service ware (CSFW) generated positive Net Present Values, making it economically viable long-term (Kaur & Acid, 2020). However, Canadian research suggests reusable packaging might prove more cost-effective and environmentally beneficial than single-use compostable alternatives, emphasizing that usage frequency significantly impacts sustainability assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024).

Additional studies highlight that while bioplastics and renewable resources support economic practices aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, challenges persist regarding affordability, usability, and infrastructure requirements (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, compostable packaging shows promise but requires careful cost and implementation evaluation, with innovations like StrawPlast demonstrating potential for circular economy promotion while minimizing environmental damage (Giordano & Mariani, 2024).
