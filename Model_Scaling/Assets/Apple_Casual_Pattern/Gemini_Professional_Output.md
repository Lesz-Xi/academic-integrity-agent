Traffic is easily the worst aspect of living in large, growing cities like Davao. With the recent boom, everyone has bought a car or motorcycle, which now chokes the main thoroughfares. The city’s road system is clearly outdated; it was built long ago without planning for the massive influx of new vehicles (Komatsuzaki, 2016). Growth simply exploded, leaving the infrastructure far behind. This project is essentially our attempt, as MMCM students, to document the daily nightmare of commuting to school.

This issue is worldwide. Research in India shows that traffic gridlock occurs when road capacity fails to meet demand, resulting in wasted time and economic loss (Samal et al., 2020). Solving this is difficult because the population keeps growing and buying more vehicles. Suggested remedies include stricter traffic enforcement, relocating major offices away from the downtown core, banning roadside vending, and building more parking structures. Studies involving students in Brazil, Chile, and China found a direct link between long commute times and poor academic performance; stress from spending hours stuck in traffic hinders studying (Tigre et al., 2017). Similar findings in Zamboanga City linked poor infrastructure, illegal parking, and ineffective traffic management—along with poor coordination among transport groups—to stressed commuters and reduced productivity (Moreno, 2023).

The Philippines faces broader infrastructure deficits, including congested airports and ports. President Marcos Jr. is continuing the "Build, Build, Build" initiative, launched in 2017, which involves massive projects valued around $81 billion. However, only about 10% of these projects were completed as of mid-2022, suggesting opportunities for international partners, such as American companies, to assist with road improvements (Philippines - Transport Infrastructure, 2022). Locally in Davao, Dionisio Abude, head of the traffic office in 2019, attributed worsening conditions to ongoing construction, bridge repairs, road widening, and driver non-compliance (Revita, 2019). The road system itself is poorly planned, featuring inadequate sidewalks and poorly timed traffic signals. Daily life depends heavily on informal transport options like jeepneys, tricycles, taxis, and UV Express vans. Jeepneys (PUJs) remain essential because they are affordable and offer flexible boarding and alighting, despite concerns about safety and air quality (Davao Public Transport Modernization Project, 2023).

To analyze this situation, we need theoretical grounding. First, we are adopting the Transportation System Performance Evaluation Framework (Pathak et al., 2019). This combines engineering, planning, and sociology to assess infrastructure reliability, accessibility, safety, and user satisfaction. Second, we will apply Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) to survey students regarding their attitude toward current transport, subjective norms (what peers think), and perceived behavioral control over their commute, measuring how these factors align with actual travel choices. Third, the Sustainable Transportation Theory (Banister, 2008) requires us to examine the environmental impact and long-term social costs of our current commutes. Finally, we will adapt the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Thompson, 2019), which normally assesses new technology adoption. We will use TAM to determine if students would actually use new solutions, like improved transit apps or better bus systems, based on whether they perceive these options as useful and easy to implement.

Numerous studies exist on traffic congestion, but practical improvements remain elusive. Since we, as MMCM students, endure these delays daily, we feel compelled to conduct this research to identify the specific challenges we face and propose actionable improvements. This research should also aid city planners and school administration in understanding student needs; better commutes could reduce stress and boost academic performance, ideally supporting sustainable urban growth according to the established theories. Our central hypothesis is that the current urban layout and infrastructure capacity are insufficient for the present student population trying to reach MMCM college daily. We must investigate further to pinpoint the exact breaking points.
