This research examines the challenging traffic situation in Davao City. Anyone familiar with the area recognizes the worsening conditions each year. The city's rapid growth has outpaced road infrastructure development as more people relocate to the area.

The study began with a desire to identify the root causes of these transportation problems. We questioned whether excessive vehicle volume, poor road planning, or inadequate public transport systems created the primary issues. Our investigation included international studies and local research to understand why commuters struggle with daily transportation.

College students at MMCM particularly drew our attention due to their unique transportation needs. Students require reliable transport to attend classes while managing tight budgets. Transportation system failures create more than inconvenience - they directly impact educational outcomes.

We selected a Descriptive Quantitative Research approach to provide concrete data supporting what residents already experience - Davao City's transportation system requires significant improvement. Four theoretical frameworks guided our analysis:

The Transportation System Performance Evaluation framework measured current system effectiveness. We examined bus punctuality, route coverage, and service frequency to assess operational performance.

The Theory of Planned Behavior analyzed individual transportation choices. We studied whether students select jeepneys for affordability or lack of alternatives, examining the decision-making process behind transport selection.

Sustainable Transportation Theory emphasized long-term viability over immediate solutions. Environmental impact considerations became essential as cities address climate change and plan for future decades.

The Technology Acceptance Model evaluated user openness to technological solutions. We assessed student willingness to adopt ride-sharing applications and electronic payment systems for transportation services.

Our methodology employed purposive sampling to select 30 respondents. This sample size, while modest, represented the MMCM student population diversity effectively. Surveys provided the most practical approach for gathering honest feedback from busy college students.

The survey examined multiple aspects of Davao City's transportation infrastructure. Questions covered wait times, safety perceptions during nighttime transport, and overall user satisfaction. Our goal involved creating a comprehensive assessment of system strengths and weaknesses.

Results proved revealing but unsurprising for anyone navigating Davao City transportation. Some aspects received acceptable ratings, but numerous areas demanded substantial improvement.

Gender differences in transportation experiences emerged as a significant finding. Female students expressed different safety concerns compared to male students. Women worried more about harassment on crowded jeepneys and walking alone to transport stops after evening classes.

Commuting frequency patterns revealed varying student experiences. Campus residents or those living nearby avoided daily traffic struggles. Students commuting from distant barangays faced constant transportation-related stress.

Reliability issues dominated student concerns. Jeepney arrival times remained unpredictable, forcing students to leave significantly earlier than necessary to ensure punctual class attendance. This practice reduced study time and sleep, creating academic performance impacts.

Information availability represented another major problem. Students lacked access to traffic delay notifications, route changes, or service interruptions. Transportation decisions relied on guesswork and hope rather than reliable information.

Comfort levels remained consistently poor. Jeepneys became overcrowded during rush hours, making studying or note review impossible. Students endured cramped conditions in vehicles navigating poorly maintained roads.

Accessibility presented significant challenges. Students with disabilities encountered additional barriers, while able-bodied students struggled with poorly designed or inconveniently located transport stops.

Safety concerns appeared frequently in responses. Beyond gender-specific issues, students worried about vehicle maintenance standards, reckless driving behavior, and crime near transport hubs.

Subjective norms influenced student attitudes toward transportation quality. Many students accepted unreliable and uncomfortable conditions as normal, adopting a "that's just how it is in Davao" mentality.

The situation need not remain unchanged. Our findings suggest several viable improvement strategies.

Infrastructure improvements require immediate attention. Better roads, organized transport stops, adequate lighting, and terminal security need government investment but remain essential for system functionality.

Safety concerns could be addressed through enhanced transport operator regulation, improved stop lighting, and potential late-night escort services for commuters.

Expanded transportation options would benefit students significantly. Current reliance on jeepneys and tricycles limits choices. Additional bus routes, improved taxi services, or student-focused bike-sharing programs could provide alternatives.

Technology offers substantial improvement potential. Real-time transport availability apps, digital payment systems, or student-designed ride-sharing platforms could transform the transportation experience.

The objective extends beyond convenience improvements. Creating a system that supports student success and well-being represents the ultimate goal. Students spending less time on transportation concerns can dedicate more energy to academic pursuits.

This research demonstrates that Davao City transportation improvement involves more than traffic management. Equity, sustainability, and student opportunity creation require consideration. These findings should inform policymakers seeking student perspective understanding, urban planners designing future transport systems, and educational institutions supporting student needs.

Better transportation ultimately improves community quality of life. Students with reliable class access show higher academic success rates. Individual benefits extend to citywide economic and social development.
