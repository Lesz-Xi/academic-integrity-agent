Congestion on major roadways, particularly those in heavily populated
metropolitan areas, has always been persistent. In recent years, Davao City has witnessed
a surge in population and rapid urbanization, leading to a corresponding increase in private
vehicles and subsequent traffic congestion. The rapid growth of vehicles outpaced the
existing infrastructures within the city, these outdated infrastructures and poorly
maintained roads are not in standards due to the lack of urban planning (Komatsuzaki,
2016). This study wants to analyze the experiences of MMCM college commuters,
examining their daily routines and challenges within the city's transportation infrastructure.
A study in India conducted by Samal, Kumar, Santhosh, and Santhakumar (2020)
emphasizes global traffic congestion as a significant issue, straining existing infrastructure
against escalating traffic demands. The resulting congestion leads to substantial wasted
working hours, negatively impacting the overall economy. Mitigating congestion proves
challenging due to population growth and increased vehicle numbers, especially twowheelers and passenger cars. Proposed measures include enforcing traffic laws,
decentralizing key organizations, regulating roadside activities, and providing ample
parking facilities. Similarly, a study by Tigre et al. (2017) in Brazil investigates the impact
of commuting time on students' academic performance across Brazil, Chile, and China.
Findings indicate that students with longer commutes experience more pronounced
academic challenges than their peers.
Research conducted in Zamboanga City reveals that traffic congestion significantly
impacts public transit users, resulting in longer travel times, heightened stress, and
decreased productivity. Factors contributing to congestion include inadequate road infrastructure, unregulated street parking, and ineffective traffic flow management.
Commuters perceive a lack of coordination among transportation authorities, hindering
effective traffic management (Moreno, 2023). Moreover, the Philippines faces
infrastructure challenges, including traffic issues, airport under capacity, and port
congestion. President Marcos Jr. plans to continue the Build, Build, Build program initiated
in 2017, covering 76 projects valued at $81 billion. Only 10% of projects were completed
as of June 2022, presenting significant opportunities for U.S. exporters in the transportation
infrastructure sector (Philippines - Transport Infrastructure, 2022).
On May 28, 2019, Dionisio Abude, the head of CTTMO, highlighted various
factors contributing to the worsening traffic situation in the city, including ongoing road
construction, bridge maintenance, expansion projects, and undisciplined drivers (Revita,
2019). In addition, Davao City's urban road networks suffer from inadequate transport
planning and traffic management, resulting in inefficiencies. Pedestrian facilities and
traffic control devices often do not meet official standards. The city heavily relies on
smaller vehicles like jeepneys, tricycles, motorbikes, taxis, and UV Express for public
transportation, with public utility jeepneys (PUJs) playing a crucial role in intracity
transport. Despite safety and environmental concerns, PUJs remain widely used due to their
accessibility and affordability (Davao Public Transport Modernization Project: Report
and Recommendation of the President, 2023).
To guide this study, four theories will be employed. The first theory is Pathak,
Thakur, and Rahman's Transportation System Performance Evaluation Framework (2019),
which integrates transportation engineering, urban planning, and social sciences. It
assesses factors such as accessibility, reliability, safety, and user satisfaction, emphasizing efficiency in infrastructure alignment with user preferences (Pathak et al., 2019). The study
will also incorporate Icek Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), examining
behavioral intention, attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral
control (Ajzen, 1991). Survey questions will gauge student views on Davao City's
transportation, covering satisfaction levels, social influences on commuting choices, and
perceived control. Statistical methods will then analyze the relationships between TPB
components and commuting behavior, offering insights for informed policy
recommendations. The third theory is the Sustainable Transportation Theory, which
emphasizes environmental and social sustainability in transportation options. It evaluates
the immediate and long-term impact on the environment and residents' well-being, guided
by sustainability aspects (Banister, 2008). Lastly, the study will use the Technology
Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis in 1989. TAM posits that the acceptance of
a computer system depends on perceived usefulness and ease of use, focusing on potential
users' perceptions (Thompson, 2019). This model guides the examination of MMCM
students' satisfaction with current transportation technologies in Davao City, aiming to
reveal expectations and preferences and understand the likelihood of embracing novel
transportation technologies in the future.
Additionally, numerous literature and studies have analyzed traffic congestion and
its impacts. However, the result has not been much satisfying. As MMCM student
commuters, the researchers recognize the urgency of conducting this study to understand
better and address challenges faced by MMCM college student commuters, providing
insights for potential improvements. Additionally, the research will inform urban planners,
policymakers, and educational institutions about student needs, fostering a more student-
friendly environment. Furthermore, addressing transportation challenges might positively
impact students' well-being and academic performance, contributing to the sustainable
development of Davao City.
Based on this data, the researchers hypothesize that the current infrastructure
inadequately meets the needs of MMCM college commuters.
