Introduction Escalating concerns regarding plastic pollution are compelling institutions to identify superior packaging solutions. University canteens, in particular, are under significant pressure to eliminate single-use plastics due to their substantial contribution to waste and emissions (Solsona, 2024). For Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM), the transition from standard plastic containers to compostable alternatives raises critical questions regarding financial feasibility and genuine sustainability. Implementing compostable packaging is a complex process involving financial management, infrastructural readiness, and consumer perception. While some literature indicates that compostable options can yield long-term savings through reduced disposal costs (Kaur & Acid, 2020), educational institutions may be deterred by high upfront material expenses. Consequently, the Mapúa MCM canteen must determine whether long-term benefits outweigh immediate operational challenges. Furthermore, consumer behavior plays a pivotal role; although biodegradable materials can promote environmental awareness (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), success depends on student engagement. A disparity often exists between institutional goals and consumer expectations, creating an "intent-action gap" that can hinder adoption (Solsona, 2024). Therefore, this research focuses on analyzing the cost-benefit ratio of switching to compostable packaging at Mapúa MCM, examining economic factors, environmental impact, and behavioral patterns. As student-researchers, we view this as a timely study on how academic institutions can lead in sustainability despite practical barriers.

Literature Review International studies indicate that transitioning university canteens to compostable packaging presents both ecological and economic advantages. Research from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies highlights that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can generate positive Net Present Values (NPVs), rendering it cost-effective over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). However, evidence from Canada suggests that reusable packaging may outperform single-use compostables in both financial and environmental metrics, emphasizing frequency of use as a key sustainability factor (Snyder & Park, 2024). Furthermore, while bioplastics support the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, challenges regarding affordability and infrastructure persist (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippine context, Yao et al. (2024) note that biodegradable materials can decompose within a month, significantly reducing waste. Innovations such as StrawPlast also promote a circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). However, the higher production costs of biodegradables remain a hurdle. Local research in Zamboanga City indicates that while plastic substitutes reduce consumption, issues regarding durability and price negatively impact consumer acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). Consequently, for Mapúa MCM, the shift requires balancing environmental objectives with financial constraints and student behavior.

Theoretical Framework Two theoretical frameworks guide this study: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA allows for a systematic comparison of the costs associated with compostable packaging against benefits such as reduced waste fees and improved institutional reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). This framework is essential for determining the long-term net value of the transition despite initial costs. Concurrently, Ajzen’s TPB (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) posits that behavioral intention is influenced by attitude, social norms, and perceived behavioral control. TPB helps explain how student perceptions of convenience and social expectations influence their support for the switch. By integrating these theories, the study creates a holistic model that addresses both economic viability and the social dynamics necessary for successful implementation.

Research Gap Despite the focus on sustainable packaging, significant gaps remain in the literature, particularly within the Philippine educational context. Existing research often relies on international models that do not account for local economic realities, infrastructure limitations, or specific student behaviors at Mapúa MCM. There is a lack of data regarding the availability of necessary support systems, such as composting facilities. Additionally, while behavioral theories are widely used, few studies examine how Filipino campus stakeholders perceive these initiatives. The perspective of canteen vendors—who manage implementation, supply chains, and costs—is frequently overlooked. Furthermore, comparisons between reusable and compostable options in local campus settings are scarce, as is an analysis of how local policies influence these transitions.

Research Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the practicality of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging. We aim to assess the long-term feasibility for vendors and analyze the attitudes, social pressures, and perceived behavioral control of students and faculty regarding this green initiative at the Mapúa MCM canteen. The study seeks to understand how to effectively implement this change by considering both social acceptance and the financial realities of vendors. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis that ensures the transition is affordable, widely supported, and effective in regulating single-use product consumption.



The push to reduce plastic pollution is driving universities to find better packaging solutions. Specifically, canteens are being urged to replace single-use plastics, which are major contributors to waste (Solsona, 2024). For Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM), switching to compostable containers raises concerns about cost and sustainability. While some studies suggest long-term savings via lower disposal fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020), the high upfront cost of materials is a barrier. Success also relies on consumer behavior; while eco-friendly materials encourage awareness, there is often a gap between student intent and action (Solsona, 2024). This study analyzes the costs versus benefits of this transition, focusing on financial, environmental, and behavioral factors.

International research shows that compostable packaging can be economically viable (Kaur & Acid, 2020), though reusable options may offer better sustainability depending on usage frequency (Snyder & Park, 2024). In the Philippines, biodegradable options are promising for waste reduction but face hurdles regarding durability, usability, and price (Mohammad, 2024). For Mapúa MCM, success requires balancing green goals with economic reality.

We utilize two frameworks: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to weigh financial pros and cons, and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to understand student attitudes and social pressures. This combination ensures we assess both the affordability of the project and the likelihood of student adoption.

Current research often relies on international data, leaving a gap regarding local Philippine contexts. We lack specific data on local infrastructure, vendor perspectives, and how Filipino students react to these changes. This study aims to fill that gap by evaluating the feasibility of the switch for vendors and the readiness of the Mapúa MCM community to adopt sustainable habits.
