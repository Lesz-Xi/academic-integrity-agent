So basically, this research is all about the crazy traffic situation in Davao City. I mean, anyone who's been there knows it's getting worse every year. The city's growing super fast, and honestly, the roads just can't keep up with all the people moving there.

The whole thing started because we wanted to figure out what's actually causing all this mess. Like, is it just too many cars? Bad road planning? Or maybe the public transport system is just not working? We looked at studies from other countries and local research too, trying to piece together why commuters are having such a hard time getting around.

What really caught our attention was how this affects college students, especially those at MMCM. Think about it - students need reliable transport to get to classes, but they're usually on tight budgets. So when the transportation system fails them, it's not just inconvenient, it actually impacts their education.

We decided to use a Descriptive Quantitative Research approach because, honestly, we needed solid numbers to back up what everyone already feels - that transportation in Davao City needs serious work. Plus, we used four different theories to make sense of everything:

First, there's the Transportation System Performance Evaluation framework. This basically helped us measure how well the current system actually works. Are buses running on time? Are there enough routes? That kind of stuff.

Then we used the Theory of Planned Behavior, which sounds fancy but really just looks at why people choose certain transportation options. Like, do students take jeepneys because they're cheap, or because they don't have other choices?

The Sustainable Transportation Theory was important too because we can't just focus on what works now - we need solutions that'll still make sense in 10 or 20 years. Climate change is real, and cities need to think about environmental impact.

And finally, the Technology Acceptance Model helped us understand how open people are to new tech solutions. Would students use a ride-sharing app if it was reliable? Are they interested in electronic payment systems?

For our research method, we used purposive sampling to pick 30 respondents. I know that doesn't sound like a huge number, but we made sure to get a good mix of people who actually represent the student population at MMCM. We did surveys because that's the most practical way to get honest feedback from a bunch of busy college students.

The survey covered different aspects of Davao City's transportation setup. We asked about everything - from how long people wait for rides to whether they feel safe using public transport at night. The goal was to get a complete picture of what's working and what definitely isn't.

What we found was pretty eye-opening, but not exactly surprising if you've ever tried to commute in Davao City. There are some things people are okay with, but way more areas that need serious improvement.

One thing that stood out was the gender differences in how people experience transportation. Female students, for example, have different safety concerns compared to male students. Women are more worried about harassment on crowded jeepneys or walking alone to transport stops after evening classes.

We also noticed patterns in how often people commute. Some students live on campus or nearby, so they don't deal with the worst traffic daily. But others are commuting from far-off barangays, and for them, transportation problems are a constant stress.

The biggest issues we identified were around reliability. Like, you never know if a jeepney is going to show up on time, or at all. Students told us they often have to leave way earlier than they should just to make sure they don't miss classes. That's not just inconvenient - it's eating into their study time and sleep.

Information provision was another major problem. There's basically no way to know if there are traffic delays, route changes, or if certain transport options aren't running. Students just have to guess and hope for the best.

Comfort is obviously not great either. Jeepneys get super crowded, especially during rush hours. Try studying on your phone or reviewing notes when you're squeezed between five other people in a vehicle that's bouncing around on potholed roads.

Accessibility was a huge concern too. Students with disabilities face extra challenges, and even able-bodied students struggle when transport stops are poorly designed or located in inconvenient places.

Safety came up a lot in our responses. Beyond the gender-specific concerns, there are general worries about vehicle maintenance, reckless driving, and crime around transport hubs.

Subjective norms - basically what people think is normal or acceptable - also played a role. Some students have just accepted that transportation will be unreliable and uncomfortable because "that's just how it is in Davao."

But here's the thing - it doesn't have to stay this way. Based on what we found, there are definitely things that can be done to improve the situation.

Infrastructure improvements are obviously needed. Better roads, more organized transport stops, proper lighting and security at terminals. This stuff requires government investment, but it's essential.

Safety concerns could be addressed through better regulation of transport operators, improved lighting at stops, and maybe even escort services for late-night commuters.

We need more transportation options too. Right now, students are mostly stuck with jeepneys and tricycles. More bus routes, better taxi services, or even bike-sharing programs could give people more choices.

Technology could really help here. Apps that show real-time transport availability, digital payment systems, or ride-sharing platforms designed for students could make a huge difference.

The goal isn't just to make transportation more convenient - though that would be great. It's about creating a system that actually supports student success and well-being. When students spend less time worrying about how they'll get to school, they can focus more on learning.

This research shows that improving transportation in Davao City isn't just about traffic management. It's about equity, sustainability, and creating opportunities for students to succeed. The findings should be useful for policymakers who want to understand what students actually need, urban planners designing future transport systems, and educational institutions trying to support their students better.

Ultimately, better transportation means better quality of life for everyone in the community. Students who can get to classes reliably are more likely to succeed academically. That benefits not just them individually, but the whole city as it develops economically and socially.
