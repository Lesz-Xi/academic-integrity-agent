Persistent gridlock plagues large urban centers globally. In Davao City, recent population expansion and urbanization have spurred a corresponding escalation in private vehicle ownership, intensifying the ensuing traffic challenges. We noticed the existing road network—poorly maintained and lacking proper urban planning—could not absorb the swift increase in vehicles (Komatsuzaki, 2016). This particular inquiry seeks to map the daily routines and transportation struggles experienced by students commuting to MMCM college. Why is this localized study necessary? It matters. Look, overall economic strain results from wasted labor hours due to congestion, an issue emphasized by a global analysis from India (Santhakumar, 2020). Such mitigation proves hard. Efforts to ease this involve regulating roadside selling, better parking, strict law enforcement, and moving key offices away from the core. Anyway, mitigating congestion requires multiple levers. Short commutes improve learning.

Commuting time has demonstrable adverse effects on student academic success, as shown by comparative research spanning Brazil, Chile, and China (Tigre et al., 2017). We see similar issues elsewhere. Investigations in Zamboanga City detail that transit users face protracted travel durations, elevated stress, and reduced output when dealing with traffic snarls. These blockages stem from insufficient roads, illegal street parking, and management failures. Moreover, commuters report poor coordination across various transport agencies, which stalls effective response (Moreno, 2023). Nationally, the Philippines struggles with port backups, airport limitations, and road traffic. President Marcos Jr. intends to pursue the $81 billion Build, Build, Build initiative, though only a tenth of the projects finished by mid-2022. This presents clear openings for US exporters targeting transport needs. Hard to fix.

Back in 2019, the head of CTTMO, Dionisio Abude, pointed to several compounding causes for the decline in traffic flow, citing roadworks, bridge repairs, expansion efforts, and driver indiscipline (Revita, 2019). I think the urban road layout in Davao suffers from weak planning; pedestrian walkways and control devices often fail standard requirements. Jeepneys, tricycles, and motorbikes dominate public movement, with public utility jeepneys (PUJs) acting as a key backbone for movement inside the city boundaries. Despite concerns about pollution and safety, their affordability keeps them popular (Davao Public Transport Modernization Project: Report and Recommendation of the President, 2023). Do we rely too much on them? Yes.

To ground this analysis, we will employ four distinct theoretical constructs. First is the Transportation System Performance Evaluation structure proposed by Pathak, Thakur, and Rahman (2019). This setup blends social science, urban design, and engineering principles, focusing on user happiness, reliability, and accessibility to measure efficiency against user wants. Second, we integrate Icek Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to probe attitude, subjective norms, perceived control, and actual intent. We will use survey questions to capture student perceptions on satisfaction, social pressures, and control over their travel habits, allowing us to correlate these components with actual commuting choices. Third, Sustainable Transportation Theory looks at long-term environmental costs and resident welfare (Banister, 2008). Fourth, we borrow from Davis’s Technology Acceptance Model (TAM, 1989), which centers on perceived ease of use and utility determining adoption rates. This TAM lens helps us assess MMCM students' receptiveness to existing transit technologies and potential new ones. Do these models offer enough clarity?

Numerous prior academic papers have dissected traffic congestion effects, but, honestly, the outcomes have not yielded satisfactory resolutions. As fellow commuters at MMCM, we feel a strong need to study these specific challenges to offer actionable data for improvement. This research should also provide urban planners and policymakers a clearer picture of student requirements, helping foster a better environment. Resolving these travel issues should improve student welfare and academic outcomes, aiding Davao’s long-term growth. We suspect infrastructure fails students. Poorly built.
