In essence, this research delves into the intricate traffic challenges prevalent in Davao City. It is widely acknowledged that the city’s rapid growth has outpaced the development of its infrastructure, resulting in a severe traffic congestion problem.

The research commenced with the objective of elucidating the underlying causes of this traffic predicament. The investigation encompassed a comprehensive analysis of various factors, including the number of vehicles on the road, the adequacy of road planning, and the effectiveness of the public transportation system.

A significant focus of the research was the impact of traffic congestion on college students, particularly those enrolled at MMCM. The study revealed that reliable transportation is crucial for students to attend classes, but their limited budgets often make it challenging to access the necessary transportation options. Consequently, transportation system failures can have a detrimental effect on their academic performance.

To substantiate the findings and provide concrete evidence of the urgent need for transportation improvements in Davao City, a Descriptive Quantitative Research approach was employed. This methodology allowed for the collection and analysis of numerical data, thereby validating the existing perceptions regarding the state of transportation in the city.

Furthermore, four distinct theories were utilized to gain a comprehensive understanding of the traffic challenges in Davao City:

1. Transportation System Performance Evaluation Framework: This framework facilitated the assessment of the current transportation system’s effectiveness. It encompassed various aspects such as the punctuality of buses, the availability of routes, and other relevant factors.

2. Theory of Planned Behavior: This theory provided insights into the decision-making processes of individuals regarding their transportation choices. It examined the factors influencing students’ preferences for specific transportation options, such as the cost-effectiveness of jeepneys or the availability of alternative choices.

3. Sustainable Transportation Theory: This theory emphasized the importance of considering long-term sustainability in transportation planning. It highlighted the need for solutions that not only address current challenges but also mitigate the environmental impact of transportation systems, particularly in the face of climate change.



Finally, the Technology Acceptance Model provided insights into the receptiveness of individuals to novel technological solutions. Specifically, it examined whether students would utilize a ride-sharing application if it demonstrated reliability and their interest in electronic payment systems.

For our research methodology, we employed purposive sampling to select 30 respondents. While this may not seem like a substantial sample size, we ensured a diverse representation of the student population at MMCM. Surveys were utilized as the most practical means of obtaining candid feedback from a busy college student demographic.

The survey encompassed various aspects of Davao City’s transportation infrastructure. We inquired about various factors, including the duration of wait times for rides and the perceived safety of utilizing public transportation at night. The objective was to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and areas requiring significant improvement.

Our findings were both enlightening and somewhat anticipated, considering the experiences of commuters in Davao City. Certain aspects of transportation are acceptable to individuals, while numerous areas necessitate substantial enhancements.

One notable observation was the gender disparities in transportation experiences. Female students, for instance, exhibit distinct safety concerns compared to male students. Women are more apprehensive about harassment on crowded jeepneys or walking alone to transport stops after evening classes.

Additionally, we identified patterns in commuting frequency. Some students reside on campus or in proximity, thereby avoiding the most congested traffic daily. Conversely, others commute from distant barangays, resulting in constant transportation-related stress.

The most significant issues identified pertain to reliability. For instance, the timeliness and frequency of jeepney arrivals are uncertain. Students frequently need to depart earlier than necessary to ensure their punctuality, which not only causes inconvenience but also encroaches upon their study time and sleep.



Information provision emerged as another significant challenge. It is virtually impossible to ascertain whether there are traffic delays, route modifications, or if certain transport options are not operational. Consequently, students are compelled to make assumptions and rely on their own judgment.



Comfort levels are also notably lacking. Jeepneys tend to become excessively crowded, particularly during peak hours. Attempting to study on a mobile device or review notes while confined between five other individuals in a vehicle that is frequently jolted by potholes presents a significant challenge.



Accessibility remains a substantial concern. Students with disabilities encounter additional obstacles, and even able-bodied individuals face difficulties when transport stops are inadequately designed or situated in inconvenient locations.



Safety issues frequently arise in our responses. Beyond gender-specific concerns, there are general apprehensions regarding vehicle maintenance, reckless driving, and crime in transport hubs.



Subjective norms, which encompass societal perceptions of what is considered normal or acceptable, also play a role. Some students have come to accept that transportation will be unreliable and uncomfortable due to the prevailing conditions in Davao.



However, it is important to recognize that this situation does not have to persist indefinitely. Based on our findings, there are undoubtedly measures that can be implemented to enhance the overall situation.



Infrastructure improvements are undoubtedly necessary. This includes the construction of better roads, the establishment of more organized transport stops, the provision of adequate lighting and security at terminals. These initiatives require government investment, but they are essential for the improvement of transportation infrastructure.



Safety concerns can be addressed through enhanced regulation of transport operators, improved lighting at stops, and potentially the implementation of escort services for late-night commuters.



The expansion of transportation options is also crucial. Currently, students primarily rely on jeepneys and tricycles. Introducing more bus routes, enhancing taxi services, or even implementing bike-sharing programs could provide individuals with greater choices.



Technology can also play a significant role in addressing these challenges. Applications that display real-time transport availability, digital payment systems, and ride-sharing platforms specifically designed for students have the potential to make a substantial impact.



The primary objective is not solely to enhance transportation convenience, although that would be a commendable outcome. Rather, the focus is on establishing a system that genuinely supports student success and well-being. When students allocate less time to concerns regarding their transportation to school, they can redirect their attention towards academic pursuits.



This research elucidates that improving transportation in Davao City transcends traffic management. It encompasses equity, sustainability, and the creation of opportunities for students to achieve academic success. The findings hold significant value for policymakers seeking to comprehend the specific needs of students, urban planners designing future transport systems, and educational institutions striving to provide superior support to their students.



Ultimately, improved transportation translates to an enhanced quality of life for all community members. Students who can reliably attend classes are more inclined to achieve academic success. This benefits them individually, while simultaneously contributing to the overall economic and social development of the city.
