Traffic congestion has long been a persistent issue on major roads, particularly in densely populated metropolitan areas. In recent years, Davao City has experienced rapid urbanization and population growth, which have led to a surge in private vehicle ownership and subsequent traffic problems. The increase in vehicles has outpaced the city’s existing infrastructure, which is outdated and poorly maintained, largely due to insufficient urban planning (Komatsuzaki, 2016). This study aims to examine the commuting experiences of MMCM college students, focusing on their daily routines and the challenges they face within the city’s transport system.



A study conducted in India by Samal, Kumar, Santhosh, and Santhakumar (2020) highlights that traffic congestion is a global concern, straining existing infrastructure as traffic demand continues to rise. This congestion results in significant time loss and negatively affects economic productivity. Addressing such congestion is challenging because of growing populations and increasing numbers of vehicles, particularly passenger cars and two-wheelers. Suggested solutions include stricter traffic law enforcement, decentralization of key offices, regulation of roadside activities, and the provision of adequate parking facilities. Similarly, Tigre et al. (2017) studied the effects of commuting time on students’ academic performance in Brazil, Chile, and China, finding that longer travel times contribute to greater academic difficulties for students.



Research in Zamboanga City likewise reveals that traffic congestion severely affects public transit users, causing longer travel durations, higher stress levels, and reduced productivity. Contributing factors include insufficient road infrastructure, unregulated street parking, and poor traffic management. Commuters also perceive a lack of coordination among transportation authorities, which hinders effective solutions (Moreno, 2023). On a broader scale, the Philippines faces numerous infrastructure challenges, including road congestion, airport undercapacity, and port delays. President Marcos Jr. has pledged to continue the Build, Build, Build program initiated in 2017, which involves 76 projects worth $81 billion. Only 10% were completed as of June 2022, highlighting opportunities for further development in the country’s transport sector (Philippines - Transport Infrastructure, 2022).



On May 28, 2019, Dionisio Abude, the head of CTTMO, cited several factors worsening Davao’s traffic conditions, such as ongoing construction projects, bridge maintenance, road expansion, and undisciplined drivers (Revita, 2019). The city’s urban road network suffers from inadequate planning and management, resulting in inefficiencies. Pedestrian areas and traffic control devices often fail to meet official standards. Public transport heavily depends on smaller vehicles like jeepneys, tricycles, motorbikes, taxis, and UV Express vans. Among these, public utility jeepneys (PUJs) remain a primary mode of intracity transport. Despite safety and environmental concerns, PUJs are still widely used because of their affordability and accessibility (Davao Public Transport Modernization Project: Report and Recommendation of the President, 2023).



To frame this research, four theoretical perspectives will be applied. First is the Transportation System Performance Evaluation Framework by Pathak, Thakur, and Rahman (2019), which integrates transportation engineering, urban planning, and social sciences to assess accessibility, reliability, safety, and user satisfaction, with an emphasis on efficiency. Second is Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (1991), which analyzes behavioral intention, attitudes, social norms, and perceived control. Survey questions will explore MMCM students’ satisfaction, social influences in commuting choices, and perceived control, with statistical analysis linking these components to commuting behavior for policy guidance. The third is the Sustainable Transportation Theory, which stresses both environmental and social sustainability in evaluating transport options and their long-term effects on communities (Banister, 2008). Lastly, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by Davis (1989) will be used to evaluate students’ perceptions of current transport technologies in Davao City, assessing perceived usefulness and ease of use to understand the potential adoption of new technologies (Thompson, 2019).



While numerous studies have addressed traffic congestion and its effects, findings have often been insufficient in proposing actionable solutions. As MMCM student commuters, the researchers see an urgent need to conduct this study to better understand and address the transport challenges faced by their peers. The insights gathered may guide urban planners, policymakers, and educational institutions in creating more student-friendly environments. Additionally, improving transport systems could enhance students’ well-being and academic performance, contributing to the sustainable development of Davao City.



Based on this information, the researchers hypothesize that current road and transport infrastructure in Davao City does not adequately meet the needs of MMCM college commuters.
