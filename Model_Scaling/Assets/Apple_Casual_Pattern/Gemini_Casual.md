Ugh, traffic. It’s seriously the worst, right? Especially here in Davao. Like, the roads have always been packed, but lately? Forget about it.

Basically, Davao is booming. Everyone’s moving here, and naturally, everyone bought a car or a motorcycle. So, the roads, which were clearly built like, a million years ago, just can’t handle it anymore. I mean, the city grew super fast, and the infrastructure is just… old. And they never really planned for all this, you know? (Shoutout to Komatsuzaki, 2016, for pointing out the obvious).

So, what are we doing with this paper? We’re just going to bug the MMCM students—us, basically—and see how much their daily commute sucks. What’s their routine like? What problems do they hit every single morning trying to get to class?

This isn't just a Davao thing, though. There was this study in India (Samal et al., 2020) that basically said, "Yeah, traffic is terrible everywhere," because the roads can’t keep up with how many vehicles people own now. And that costs everyone money because we’re all just sitting there burning gas and wasting time instead of working or, you know, sleeping. Fixing it is hard because more people keep moving here and buying more bikes and cars. They suggested some obvious stuff, like actually enforcing the traffic rules, maybe moving some offices out of the city center, stopping people from selling stuff on the sidewalk, and building more parking lots—which is fine, I guess.

Also, looking at other countries, there was this thing Tigre et al. (2017) did in Brazil and a couple of other places. They checked how commute time messes with students' grades. And surprise, surprise: if you spend forever on the bus or in traffic, your grades aren't going to be great. Makes sense, right? You show up late, stressed, and exhausted. Why does this matter? Because we’re students, and our grades matter (sometimes).

It gets closer to home with a study in Zamboanga City. Moreno (2023) found that traffic there screws over public transport users—longer trips, super stressed out, not productive. Their road setup is bad, people park wherever they want, and traffic cops don't seem to know what the other one is doing. The commuters there felt like nobody was talking to each other at the transportation department.

The whole Philippines is kind of a mess infrastructure-wise, not just traffic. We've got airport problems and port backups too. Marcos Jr. is trying to bring back that "Build, Build, Build" thing from 2017, which is supposed to be like 76 huge projects, costing eighty-one billion dollars or something insane. But get this: as of mid-2022, they’d only finished like ten percent of it. So, apparently, there’s a huge chance for American companies to jump in and help fix our roads and stuff (Philippines - Transport Infrastructure, 2022). Cool.

Back to Davao specifically, way back in 2019, this guy Dionisio Abude (head of CTTMO back then) basically blamed everything: they were building roads, fixing bridges, putting up new stuff, *and* drivers are undisciplined (Revita, 2019). So, yeah, our road plan here is weak, and traffic management is just… inefficient. Even the things we have for walking and the traffic lights aren't up to proper standards, I hear.

We run mostly on these smaller vehicles—jeepneys, tricycles, taxis, UV Express. The jeepneys (PUJs) are the kings of getting around the city, even though they're loud, unsafe, and bad for the air. But hey, they’re cheap and they stop everywhere, so people use them. (The government is trying to modernize them, but that's another headache, 2023).

Okay, now for the boring part where we justify why we chose these four random theories. We need some structure, I guess.

First, we’re using this **Transportation System Performance Evaluation Framework** from Pathak and his friends (2019). It’s supposed to look at engineering stuff, city planning, and how people feel all mixed together. We’ll use it to check if our roads are actually accessible, reliable, safe, and if people are generally happy with how things are laid out compared to what they actually need.

Second, we’re stealing **Icek Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)** (1991). This one is super common in social science papers. It checks three things: what you think about doing something (attitude), what your friends/family think you should do (subjective norm), and how much control you actually feel like you have (perceived control). So, for our survey, we’re gonna ask students: How do you feel about the transport here? Do your parents influence how you commute? Do you feel stuck with the jeepney no matter what? Then we crunch the numbers to see if these feelings actually match how often they commute in certain ways.

Third, there’s the **Sustainable Transportation Theory**. This one is about being green and fair. We’ll check the short-term and long-term impact of this awful traffic on the air and on us—the residents—to make sure we aren't totally ruining the future (Banister, 2008).

Finally, to wrap up the required theories, we’re using the **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** from Davis (1989). This model usually checks if people will use a new computer program. It argues that people adopt tech if they think it’s useful and easy to use. For us? We’ll use it to see how happy MMCM students are with the *current* tech (like apps or whatever) and if they’d even bother trying out some new smart traffic app or a new type of ride-sharing if the city rolled it out.

So, yeah, tons of people have studied traffic jams. But honestly, the answers haven't been that great. We, as MMCM students who actually deal with this garbage every day, feel like we *have* to do this study. We need to figure out what the real problems are for us, so maybe we can suggest some fixes.

Plus, if we actually figure this out, it could help the city planners and the university know what students actually need, making campus life less of a nightmare. If we solve traffic stress, maybe our grades will go up? Who knows. It’ll definitely help Davao move forward sustainably, I guess.

Basically, our big hunch, based on staring out the window during rush hour, is that the roads we have right now are totally insufficient for the college crowd here at MMCM. It’s just not cutting it.
