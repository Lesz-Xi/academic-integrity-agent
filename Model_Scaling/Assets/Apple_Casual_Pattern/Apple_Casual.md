The study looks into the growing traffic jams in Davao City, which are getting worse because of more people moving in and the city expanding. It checks out both international and local research to figure out what problems commuters are dealing with and what’s causing the congestion. The main focus is on MMCM college students and how the city’s transportation system is holding up. The research uses a Descriptive Quantitative approach and four theories to get a full picture of how effective transportation is. They picked 30 people randomly for a survey to gather data. The survey looked at different parts of Davao City’s transportation system, giving useful tips for making things better and helping policymakers, urban planners, and schools understand what students need for a more sustainable and student-friendly environment. The study also looked at how happy commuters are with the transportation services, pointing out what they like and what needs fixing. It noted differences based on gender and how often people commute, and found that many are unhappy with things like reliability, information, comfort, accessibility, safety, and social norms. The results suggest making improvements like better infrastructure, addressing safety issues, offering more options, and using technology to boost overall satisfaction and ensure fair access to transportation, which would make commuting better and improve the community’s well-being.
