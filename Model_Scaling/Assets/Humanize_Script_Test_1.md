The research approach selected here is a quantitative descriptive-survey design. A descriptive survey, as defined by Apuke (2021), involves collecting data from a specified pool of participants via questionnaires or structured interviews; this captures measurable opinions, behaviors, or perceptions regarding a chosen topic. This particular design suits the research because the goal is to measure the attitudes, practical hurdles, and financial issues canteen staff encounter when considering a switch from plastic containers to compostable ones.

Adopting a quantitative method is sound; the study demands numerical evidence that allows for statistical assessment to spot trends in the participants’ answers (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Objectivity in gathering and assessing the data is maintained by concentrating on quantifiable metrics like expense management, how easily operations can run, and the supposed environmental advantages. Moreover, this design supports the cost-benefit evaluation central to the research, which requires strictly quantifiable information (Kenton, 2021).

This descriptive-survey setup naturally connects with the study's guiding principle, Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The TPB centers on how attitudes, the influence of others (subjective norms), and perceived personal control shape choices and actions. Utilizing this framework helps capture staff members' views on the difficulty and viability of swapping out plastic for compostable materials, especially concerning operational workflow and budget impacts.

The choice to conduct this work at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM) offers necessary location relevance; the canteen is a major source of campus waste. Getting the perspective of the canteen staff—those directly responsible for food handling, packing, and serving—guarantees the collected figures genuinely reflect lived experience concerning feasibility problems, workload changes, and the actual costs involved in moving away from standard plastic packaging.
