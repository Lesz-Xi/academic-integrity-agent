The research employs a quantitative descriptive-survey design. A descriptive survey, in essence, gathers measurable data—opinions, behaviors, or perceptions—from a specific participant group, often through structured interviews or questionnaires (Apuke, 2021). This design fits perfectly here, given that the objective is quantifying the attitudes, practical difficulties, and monetary constraints canteen staff face when contemplating a shift from conventional plastic to compostable containers.

Using a quantitative approach seems correct; statistical evaluation needs numerical findings to identify clear patterns in the staff responses (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Objectivity during data collection and assessment gets maintained by focusing strictly on measurable factors such as expense handling, ease of workflow, and perceived green benefits. This descriptive setup also naturally aligns with the cost-benefit assessment crucial to the study, which demands strictly quantifiable information (Kenton, 2021).

This survey structure connects well with the research’s underpinning concept, Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). TPB focuses on how an individual's attitudes, peer influence (subjective norms), and sense of control shape their subsequent actions. Applying this framework captures staff perspectives on both the operational difficulty and the overall viability of substituting plastic with compostable items, particularly concerning budget implications and workflow changes.

Choosing Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM) gives the work crucial localized relevance; the campus canteen generates substantial waste. Getting direct input from the staff—those hands-on with serving, packing, and handling food—ensures the resulting figures truly mirror their lived reality regarding workload shifts, feasibility issues, and the actual expenses tied to abandoning standard plastic packaging.
