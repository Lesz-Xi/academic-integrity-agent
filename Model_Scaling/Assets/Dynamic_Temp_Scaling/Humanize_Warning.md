The chosen research methodology employs a quantitative descriptive-survey design. Apuke (2021) explains that a descriptive survey gathers measurable opinions, behaviors, or perceptions from a selected group using questionnaires or structured interviews concerning a specific subject. This design fits perfectly, since the primary aim involves quantifying canteen staff attitudes, operational difficulties, and financial concerns related to switching from conventional plastic items to compostable alternatives.

Using a quantitative approach makes sense here; the investigation requires numerical proof suitable for statistical evaluation, helping identify patterns across participant responses (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). We uphold objectivity during data collection and assessment by focusing solely on measurable criteria, such as expense management, ease of daily operations, and perceived ecological benefits. This framework also directly aids the cost-benefit analysis at the core of the study, which fundamentally demands strictly quantifiable data (Kenton, 2021).

This descriptive-survey arrangement aligns smoothly with the guiding conceptual structure: Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). TPB focuses precisely on how individual attitudes, external pressures from peers (subjective norms), and assessment of personal control ultimately direct decisions and subsequent actions. Applying this theoretical lens allows us to properly capture staff perspectives on the viability and difficulty of replacing plastic packaging with compostable materials, especially regarding budget implications and workflow adjustments.

Selecting Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM) as the site offers crucial contextual importance; their canteen generates a sizable portion of the campus’s refuse. Securing the viewpoints of the actual canteen employees—those directly managing food preparation, packaging, and distribution—ensures that the resulting figures genuinely represent lived realities concerning workload shifts, feasibility challenges, and the concrete expenses associated with abandoning standard plastic containers.
