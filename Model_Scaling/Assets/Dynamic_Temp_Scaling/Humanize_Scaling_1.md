The research strategy selected relies on a quantitative, descriptive survey design. This method collects measurable facts—like attitudes, actions, or how people see things—about a defined population using structured tools such as questionnaires or interviews, just as Apuke (2021) lays out. This particular design works nicely because the goal centers on measuring the canteen staff’s feelings, the practical challenges, and the financial issues involved in switching from plastic to compostable packaging.

Choosing a quantitative technique is logical; the study demands numerical evidence for statistical processing, letting researchers spot trends in participant responses (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Items such as cost management, how easy things are to run, and the perceived environmental upsides offer data points that can be counted. This preserves objectivity throughout the data gathering and evaluation stages. Also, this framework supports the cost-benefit assessment—a core element of this study—which strictly necessitates measurable information (Kenton, 2021).

This descriptive-survey structure meshes well with Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), which frames the entire inquiry. TPB centers on how a person's specific attitudes, external influences (norms imposed by others), and their sense of personal command shape their eventual decisions and subsequent behaviors. Applying this conceptual structure lets us capture the staff’s take on the viability and difficulty of swapping plastic for compostable goods, especially when factoring in budget limits and alterations to standard procedures.

Executing this work within the setting of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM) furnishes essential local context; the campus canteen produces a large volume of waste. Getting feedback straight from the food service personnel—the folks managing, packaging, and serving meals—guarantees the figures we collect truly represent the day-to-day realities concerning workflow adjustments, the real price tag of moving away from conventional plastic, and feasibility snags encountered every shift.
