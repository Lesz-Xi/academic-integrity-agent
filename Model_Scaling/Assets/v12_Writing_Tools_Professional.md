In essence, the pervasive issue of plastic pollution exerts significant pressure on educational institutions to explore alternative packaging solutions. This predicament presents a complex challenge for school kitchens, which face an overwhelming demand to reduce single-use plastics due to their substantial waste generation and environmental impact (Solsona, 2024).
A notable example is Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, which has made the transition from conventional plastic to compostable packaging. This shift raises pertinent questions regarding financial considerations and the long-term viability of such a change. Implementing compostable packaging entails a multifaceted process that encompasses cost management, infrastructure development, and assessing student receptiveness.
While some studies suggest that compostable options can yield cost savings in the long run by mitigating waste expenses (Kaur & Acid, 2020), schools may still exhibit hesitation due to the initial financial burden associated with the transition. For Mapúa MCM canteen, this necessitates a thorough evaluation of whether the long-term benefits outweigh the immediate financial challenges. Furthermore, student perceptions play a crucial role in the success of such initiatives. Research indicates that eco-friendly packaging, such as biodegradable alternatives, fosters responsible behavior among individuals (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). However, the actual success of these efforts hinges on the extent to which students are informed and actively participate.
Consequently, aligning the campus’s aspirations with the expectations of its students presents a formidable challenge, as there is often a disparity between stated intentions and actual actions (Solsona, 2024).
This study specifically examines the financial and environmental implications of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging within the Mapúa MCM canteen. It delves into the economic aspects, environmental considerations, behavioral factors, and other relevant dimensions. As student researchers, we recognize the significance of this study, particularly in demonstrating how educational institutions like ours can lead the way in adopting sustainable practices while addressing the practical challenges of cost and implementation.



In light of international studies, transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging in educational institutions presents a mutually beneficial solution for both environmental sustainability and budgetary considerations. Research conducted at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies revealed that compostable food service ware (CSFW) offers schools substantial advantages and yields favorable long-term returns, positioning it as a viable and enduring choice (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Conversely, evidence from Canada suggests that reusable packaging, which facilitates multiple uses, may prove more cost-effective and environmentally advantageous compared to disposable compostable packaging. This underscores the significance of usage frequency in determining the longevity and sustainability of packaging options (Snyder & Park, 2024). Furthermore, studies emphasize the positive economic impact of bioplastics and renewable resources, aligning with the United Nations’ objectives. However, challenges persist in terms of cost, usability, and the initial implementation process (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the adoption of compostable packaging holds promise, but careful consideration of associated costs is imperative. Yao et al. (2024) demonstrated that biodegradable materials exhibit rapid decomposition within a month, effectively mitigating plastic waste. Similarly, StrawPlast, a bioplastic-straw composite, presents an innovative approach to recycling and environmental preservation (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Nevertheless, studies caution that biodegradable packaging often incurs higher costs due to increased production expenses and the need for advanced technology. While potential savings in waste management and compliance with regulations may be realized in the long run, the initial investment remains a concern (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). In Zamboanga City, local studies indicate that the adoption of plastic alternatives has successfully reduced single-use plastic consumption. However, challenges persist in areas such as recycling, decomposition, and public acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). It is evident that while public support for environmentally friendly practices exists, concerns regarding the efficacy, cost, and other factors continue to influence decision-making. In the context of institutions like the Mapúa MCM canteen, transitioning to compostable packaging necessitates a delicate balance between environmental sustainability and budgetary constraints. As student researchers, we acknowledge the limitations inherent in such a transition. However, we believe that analyzing the long-term benefits and short-term challenges is crucial in determining the feasibility and sustainability of this change on campus.

To guide the transition from plastic to compostable packaging at Mapúa MCM, two primary frameworks can be employed: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA involves evaluating the costs associated with compostable packaging against its potential benefits, such as reduced waste management expenses, environmental conservation, and enhanced school reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). This analysis enables us to assess the financial viability of the transition, even considering the increased material costs.

Simultaneously, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), developed by Ajzen (1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024), posits that an individual’s intention to engage in a specific behavior is influenced by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. In essence, the attitudes of individuals towards compostable packaging, their perceptions of societal expectations, and their perceived ease of implementation significantly impact their willingness to support the transition.

Therefore, the integration of these theories provides a comprehensive framework that combines financial considerations with behavioral factors. This approach ensures that the study not only evaluates the financial feasibility of the transition but also considers the social dynamics that determine its long-term success at Mapúa MCM.



In recent times, sustainable packaging has garnered significant attention, particularly in Philippine educational institutions. However, there remains a substantial gap in our knowledge, particularly in the context of Philippine schools. Numerous studies adopt international models, which may not align with the financial constraints, logistical limitations, or the behavior of students in local universities such as Mapúa MCM. For instance, there is a lack of comprehensive assessments regarding the availability of appropriate systems for compostable packaging on campuses, including waste segregation and composting facilities. Furthermore, while behavioral theories like the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) are frequently employed, there are limited studies that delve into the perceptions of Filipino students and faculty regarding sustainable packaging. Additionally, vendors, who are the primary stakeholders responsible for implementing and managing sustainable packaging initiatives, often receive insufficient attention. Despite their crucial role in addressing cost, supply, and durability concerns, vendors are frequently overlooked.
In contrast, reusable packaging is often presented as an alternative option, but there are limited studies that evaluate its practicality when combined with compostable packaging on campus. Furthermore, the impact of school regulations and local laws on these changes remains unclear.
This study aims to investigate the feasibility of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging by examining the long-term implications for vendors and assessing the attitudes of students and faculty at the Mapúa MCM canteen. The objective is to comprehend the potential challenges and opportunities associated with this transition, considering social acceptance and the financial considerations of vendors. Ultimately, the goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the feasibility of this shift, ensuring its financial viability and garnering support from the entire campus to reduce single-use packaging.
