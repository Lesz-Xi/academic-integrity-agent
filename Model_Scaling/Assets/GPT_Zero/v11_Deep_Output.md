The growing environmental concern over plastic pollution has placed real
pressure (to be fair) on institutions to explore more eco-friendly stuff alternatives. Depends. Specifically,
university canteens face increasing demand to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics,
which contribute heavily to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona,
2024). Within the context of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, the maybe switching
from conventional plastic food materials to compostable food materials raises critical
questions about cost saving side and long-term eco-friendly. Shifting to compostable
materials is not a straightforward solution, as it involves balancing financial
considerations, facilities readiness, and consumer acceptance. studies have
suggested that compostable options can generate long-term cost savings through reduced
waste disposal (Kaur & Acid. But 2020), institutions may still hesitate due to higher material
costs. In the case of the Mapúa MCM canteen, such factors make it necessary to examine
whether the good stuff later on can outweigh the immediate financial and operational
constraints. Equally important are consumer opinions and behaviors regarding
compostable stuff. From what we read, it looks like green materials such as
biodegradable alternatives promote environmental responsibility (Giordano & Mariani. But 2024, Daramola et al., 2025), the actual success of such initiatives depends on student
awareness and participation. This presents a challenge in aligning institutional efforts with
consumer expectations, as gaps between intention (worth mentioning) and practice may hinder the effectiveness
of the transition (Solsona, 2024). This study focuses on conducting a cost-benefit analysis
of shifting from plastic to compostable stuff in the Mapúa MCM canteen, with
particular attention to the financial, environmental, behavioral, and really more dimensions of this
4
change. As student-researchers, we view this research problem as both timely and essential,
especially in highlighting how academic institutions can lead in adopting long-lasting
practices addressing the realities of cost and put in place barriers. International studies reveal that shifting from plastic to compostable items in
university canteens provides both environmental and economic advantages. Research at the
Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that compostable food service ware
(CSFW) can be beneficial for the institutions. But With positive Net Present Values (NPVs),
making it a cost-effective long-term option (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, evidence from
Canada suggests that reusable containers, when used multiple times, may be more cost-
efficient and environmentally beneficial compared to single-use compostable, showing that
frequency of use is an important factor in eco-friendly assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024). And, studies highlight that bioplastics and renewable resources support economic
practices and the United Nations’ eco-friendly Development Goals, challenges
remain in terms of affordability. But Usability, and setup requirements (Ikechukwu,
2024, Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the move toward compostable items
also presents promising outcomes but requires careful evaluation of costs and
set up. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable materials can decompose
within a month, big reducing plastic waste and pollution. In the same way, innovations
like StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, provide opportunities for
promoting a circular economy and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano &
Mariani, 2024). Still, studies emphasize that biodegradable items materials are often
more expensive than plastics due to production costs and the need for updated technologies,
long-term savings may arise from reduced waste management expenses and
5
alignment with green policies (Yao et al.. But 2024, Ikechukwu, 2024). At the local
level, studies in Zamboanga City show that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single-
use plastic consumption, but (though this is debatable) challenges persist in recyclability, biodegradability, consumer, and especially more acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). Basically, the feedback shows that there
is support for green stuff. But Actual problems with durability and usability - plus cost too remain notable barriers. It looks like these results mean for institutions
such as university canteens, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, the transition to
compostable items requires balancing environmental goals with financial realities and
consumer behavior. As student-researchers, we recognize these constraints but believe that
analyzing both the good stuff later on and short-term challenges is critical in determining
whether such a transition is feasible and green within the campus context. The transition from plastic to compostable stuff in the context of Mapua MCM
can be effectively guided with two theoretical lenses, the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory
(CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory
provides a systematic comparison on the costs of compostable materials with its potential
benefits, such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced
institutional reputation. (Mishan & Quah, 2020). In the context of the Mapúa MCM
canteen, this structure enables an evaluation of whether the transition can generate
positive net value in the long term, despite challenges such as higher material costs. At the
same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), formulated by Ajzen (1991, as cited in
Sarmah & Singh, 2024) stated that the TPB “posits that an individual's intention to engage
in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived
behavioral control” (p. 03). The TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable containers,
6
perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such changes influence students’
and consumers’ willingness to participate in and support the transition. For example, even
if compostable containers is economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to
perceived (not everyone agrees) inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its
success. Together, these theories provide a complete plan that integrates economic
evaluation with behavioral insights. The combination ensures that the study does not only
address the financial feasibility of adopting compostable items but also considers the
social dynamics that determine whether the transition will be eco-friendly and effective in
practice in the Mapua MCM community. long-lasting containers has received increasing attention in recent years, Still,
several gaps remain in the existing research, Namely within the context of Philippine
educational institutions. Many studies are based on international models, which may not
accurately reflect the economic conditions, setup limitations, and behavioral
dynamics present in local university settings such as Mapúa MCM. For example, there is
limited investigation into whether campuses have the necessary systems to support
compostable items, including waste segregation and composting facilities. And, behavioral theories. But Such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, have been
widely applied, few studies have examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and
respond to green containers initiatives. The role of canteen vendors is sometimes
overlooked, despite their involvement in start and their concerns about cost and durability - plus supply too. Reusable materials is also often discussed as a possible alternative,
yet studies evaluating its practicality alongside compostable options in campus
7
environments are scarce. There is also a need to examine how institutional policies and
local regulations either support or hinder these transitions. This study aims to determine the feasibility of transitioning from plastic to
compostable stuff by assessing the long-term workable for vendors and evaluating the
attitudes, perceived social pressures, and perceived behavioral control of the students and
professors in adopting the long-lasting practice in the Mapúa MCM canteen. This study
seeks to understand how the transition can be effectively put in place within the campus,
considering not just the social acceptance but also the economic implications for the
canteen vendors. The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding that guarantees
the shift is financially realistic and fully supported by the whole campus community to
contribute in regulating the use of single-use products.
