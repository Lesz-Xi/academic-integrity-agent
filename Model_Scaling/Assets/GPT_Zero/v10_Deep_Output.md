Everyone cares more about plastic trash lately, so schools gotta look into greener packaging stuff. Depends. Uni cafeterias, especially, are getting heat to stop using so much single-use plastic—that stuff makes tons of garbage and pumps out bad gases (Solsona, 2024). Like, at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, if they switch from regular plastic food containers to stuff you can compost, big questions pop up about saving money and if "green" actually sticks around. Switching to compostable stuff isn't simple. You gotta juggle the money side, if the current systems can handle it, and whether people will even use it. People have shown that compostable options *might* save cash long-term because you (at least in our context) pay less to dump waste (Kaur & Acid, 2020). But schools might still be nervous because the packaging itself costs more upfront. For Mapúa MCM’s canteen specifically, we need to look hard at whether the good stuff coming later really beats the immediate money problems and setup headaches. What students think matters, too. Research says materials that look green, like stuff that breaks down, make people feel responsible for the planet (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). Success really rides on if students know about it and actually join in. That’s a headache—trying to match what the school does with what the customers expect, because people often *say* they’ll do one thing but actually do another (Solsona, 2024). This paper dives into checking the costs versus the perks of ditching plastic for compostable stuff at the Mapúa MCM canteen, (a common issue here) focusing hard on the money, the green side, and how people act about the switch. As student-researchers, we think this problem is super timely and important—it shows how schools can actually lead the way in being green while dealing with real money issues and the barriers already in place. International research shows that trading plastic for compostable stuff in campus cafeterias actually helps both the environment and the wallet. Some research at Middlebury found that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can actually be good for the schools, showing positive Net Present Values (NPVs)—so it’s a good deal over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). But, stuff from Canada suggests that if you use reusable containers over and over, that’s even cheaper and greener than using compostable single-use items, so how often you reuse things really changes the score (Snyder & Park, 2024). Also, studies point out that bioplastics and stuff from renewable sources help green business goals and the UN’s targets, even though making them affordable and easy to use—plus getting the systems ready—is still tricky (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, moving to compostable packaging looks good too, but you gotta watch the costs and what systems you have in place. Yao et al. (2024) said that biodegradable stuff can rot away in just a month, which seriously cuts down on plastic trash and pollution. Innovations like StrawPlast, which mixes straw bits with bioplastics, offer ways to boost a circular economy and cut down on environmental damage (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Still, folks emphasize that these biodegradable containers usually cost more than plastic because of how they’re made and needing newer tech, though you might save money later by spending less on trash management and staying in line with green rules (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Down in Zamboanga City, going for plastic replacements cut back on single-use plastic use, but problems hang around with recycling, how fast it breaks down, what customers think, and even more stuff (Mohammad, 2024). Feedback from people involved shows that even though they like the idea of eco-friendly packaging, real-world worries like how tough it is, if it’s easy to use, the price, and especially other factors are still major roadblocks. These findings tell us that for schools like Mapúa MCM’s canteen, switching to compostable containers means balancing green goals with the actual money situation and how students behave. We get these limitations, but we think digging into both the long-term wins and the immediate struggles is key to seeing if this switch actually makes sense on campus. We can use two main theories to guide the move from plastic to compostable packaging at Mapua MCM: the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA just gives us a structured way to compare the cost of compostable packaging against its upsides—like saving money on trash hauling, the environmental payoff, and making the school look better. (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For Mapúa MCM’s canteen, this setup lets us figure out if the switch actually makes money in the long run, even with higher material prices right now. At the same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which Ajzen cooked up (1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024), says that "what a person intends to do is set by their attitudes, what others expect them to do, and how much control they feel they have over doing it” (p. 03). TPB explains that how students feel about compostable stuff, what they think their friends expect, and how easy it is to (worth mentioning) change habits all shape whether they will support and actually use the new packaging. For instance, even if switching saves money, students might fight it if they find it inconvenient or just don’t care about the environment much. These two theories together give us a solid framework. It makes sure we look not just at if it makes financial sense, but also at the human side that decides if the change will actually be green and work in real life in the Mapua MCM community. Green packaging has been getting a lot of buzz lately; but, honestly, there are still holes in what we know, especially about Philippine colleges. A lot of research comes from international examples, which might not match up with the money struggles, system limits, and student attitudes we see locally at Mapúa MCM. For example, we don't know much about if the campus actually has the systems set up right now—like bins for separating trash and actual composting areas. What’s more, even though we use theories like TPB a lot, very few papers look at how Filipino students and teachers *actually* react when the school rolls out a green packaging thing. People who run the cafeterias—the vendors—are often ignored, even though they have to deal with putting the new stuff into practice and (though this is debatable) worry about cost, how tough it is, getting supplies, and seriously, tons of other stuff. Reusable packaging often gets talked about as a realistic backup, but there aren't many studies comparing how practical it is versus compostable stuff on a campus. We also need to check out how the school's own rules and local laws either help or block these shifts. This study tries to nail down if switching from plastic to compostable packaging is realistic by checking out the long-term outlook for vendors and by measuring what students and professors think, what social pressure they feel, and how much control they think they have in adopting this green practice at the Mapúa MCM canteen. We want to figure out how to make the switch stick on campus, looking beyond just if people accept it to also seeing how it impacts the canteen vendors’ wallets. The big goal here is to make sure the shift makes money sense and that the whole campus community actually gets behind it so we can actually start limiting single-use products.
