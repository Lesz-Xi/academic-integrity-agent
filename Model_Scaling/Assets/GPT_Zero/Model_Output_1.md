The mounting environmental worries about plastic waste are forcing institutions to look for packaging options that last longer. Specifically, university cafeterias face rising pressure to cut back on single-use plastics—these contribute heavily to waste and greenhouse gases [Solsona, 2024]. In the setting of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, moving from standard plastic food wraps to packaging that composts brings up key issues about making money and true long-term support. Switching to compostable materials isn't a simple fix; it means balancing money worries, having the right infrastructure ready, and getting customers on board. While some research suggests compostable choices can save money over time due to lower disposal fees [Kaur & Acid, 2020], schools might still hold back because the initial material prices are steeper. For the Mapúa MCM canteen specifically, these elements demand an examination of whether the lasting upsides offset the immediate financial and operational hurdles. Consumer attitudes matter just as much. Studies show that while eco-friendly stuff like biodegradable alternatives encourage responsibility [Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025], the actual success of these projects relies on student knowledge and their willingness to participate. This sets up a conflict—lining up what the institution wants with what consumers expect—since the difference between what people intend to do and what they actually do can derail the entire shift [Solsona, 2024]. This research concentrates on performing a cost-benefit assessment for swapping plastic out for compostable packaging at the Mapúa MCM canteen, paying close attention to the money side, the environmental impact, and how behavior plays a role in this adjustment. As student-researchers, we feel this problem is both necessary and timely; it highlights how academic centers can lead by adopting sustainable methods while dealing realistically with cost and implementation setbacks.

International work indicates that moving university cafeterias away from plastic toward compostable containers brings both environmental and economic gains. Middlebury Institute research, for instance, determined that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can genuinely benefit the institutions—even showing positive Net Present Values (NPVs)—making it an affordable long-term move [Kaur & Acid, 2020]. Still, Canadian findings suggest that reusable packaging, when cycled often enough, is better both financially and environmentally than single-use compostable options; usage frequency becomes a key variable in sustainability scoring [Snyder & Park, 2024]. On top of that, some reports stress that using bioplastics and renewable inputs supports green economics and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, though affordability, usability, and infrastructure needs remain hurdles [Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025]. In the Philippines, while embracing compostable wraps shows positive promise, a careful look at costs and setup is needed. Yao and colleagues [2024] found that biodegradable items can break down within four weeks, drastically cutting plastic pollution. Innovations like StrawPlast, which merges straw fibers with bioplastics, likewise offer ways to boost a circular economy and lessen environmental harm [Giordano & Mariani, 2024]. Still, studies stress that biodegradable packaging materials usually cost more than plastic because of how they are made and the new technologies required; however, long-term relief might come from lower waste management fees and better alignment with green policies [Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024]. Locally, studies in Zamboanga City confirm that using plastic substitutes cut down on single-use plastic consumption, yet problems with recyclability, biodegradability, and public buy-in still exist [Mohammad, 2024]. Feedback from involved parties shows support for green packaging, but practical worries about durability, ease of use, and price tags remain major obstacles. These results show that for places like university cafeterias, including Mapúa MCM, the switch demands balancing environmental objectives against the hard financial facts and how people actually behave. We recognize these limits, but analyzing both the future payoff and the immediate struggles seems essential to judging if this shift is possible and lasting on campus.

Guiding the switch from plastic to compostable options at Mapua MCM draws on two main academic structures—Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA offers a systematic way to compare the expenses of compostable materials against potential rewards like lower waste costs, environmental gains, and a better school image [Mishan & Quah, 2020]. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this framework lets us gauge if the switch generates a positive net worth down the road, despite higher upfront material prices. At the same time, Ajzen’s TPB (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) puts forward that what someone intends to do hinges on their attitudes, what their peers think, and how much control they feel they have over the action (p. 03). TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging, perceived social pressure, and how easy it feels to adopt the changes all affect the willingness of students and other consumers to back the transition. For instance, even if the compostable switch makes financial sense, pushback from consumers who find it inconvenient or who don't care about the environment can stop the project dead. These theories combine well—they merge economic scoring with behavioral understanding. This pairing ensures the research tackles not just whether adopting compostable packaging is affordable, but also the social currents determining if the change sticks in the Mapua MCM community long-term.

Sustainable packaging has garnered much attention lately; still, gaps exist in current writing, especially concerning Philippine schools. Many reports rely on global blueprints that might not accurately reflect the local economic situations, infrastructure limits, or behavioral norms at places like Mapúa MCM. Limited investigation exists, for example, into whether campuses have the needed support systems—waste sorting and actual composting facilities. Also, while behavioral theories like TPB are used widely, few papers examine how Filipino faculty and students actually react to green packaging pushes. The canteen vendors’ role gets overlooked sometimes, even though they execute the change and worry about cost, strength, and supply. Reusable packaging gets mentioned as an alternative, yet studies comparing its real-world use against compostable items in campus settings are rare. We also need to look at how institutional rules and local laws either help or block these movements.

This research sets out to figure out if moving from plastic to compostable wraps is possible by checking the long-term staying power for vendors and by assessing the attitudes, social pressures, and sense of control felt by both students and professors when adopting the green practice at the Mapúa MCM canteen. The study aims to map out how the shift can stick locally, looking beyond just social acceptance to the financial side for the canteen sellers. The goal here is better insight—a way to guarantee the move is financially sound and fully backed by everyone on campus, which contributes to regulating single-use products.
