The growing environmental concern over plastic pollution has placed big
pressure (a tricky point) on institutions to explore more eco-friendly packaging alternatives. Obviously. like,,cafes on campus face increasing demand to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics plus which contribute heavily to waste generation—and don't forget greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona,
2024).Within the context of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao plus (something we noticed) the potential transition
from conventional plastic food packaging to compostable food packaging leads to some important questions about cost efficiency—and don't forget long-term eco-friendly. Tricky stuff. Shifting to compostable
packaging is not a straightforward solution,as it involves balancing (not everyone agrees) financial

suggested that compostable options can generate long-term cost savings through reduced
