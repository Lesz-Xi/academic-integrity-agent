The mounting environmental worry about plastic garbage has really pushed institutions to start hunting for packaging choices that are better for the planet. Why does this matter? Because we’re drowning in trash. Specifically, university cafeterias—like the one at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao—are getting heavy heat to ditch single-use plastics, which dump tons of waste and pump out greenhouse gases (Solsona, 2024). We immediately wondered if switching to compostable containers here would actually save money long-term or just create a different set of headaches concerning cost and infrastructure readiness. The shift isn't simple; you have to weigh the money, the facility’s ability to handle the new waste stream, and how students react. Look, some research suggests compostable stuff *can* lead to long-term savings on disposal fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020), but the upfront material cost is usually higher. That’s the dilemma for Mapúa MCM’s canteen: can the future gains possibly cover today’s operational hurdles? Consumer attitudes, too, are huge. Even though sustainable materials promote green thinking (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), if students don't actually participate or understand the difference, the whole effort stalls. This creates a gap between what the institution tries to do and what consumers actually do (Solsona, 2024). So, our study zeros in on checking the costs versus benefits—financial, environmental, and behavioral—of ditching plastic for compostable stuff right here on campus. As student researchers, we think this study is timely, showing how schools can lead on sustainability while facing real-world barriers like budget constraints. Simple, right?

Internationally, when university canteens move from plastic to compostables, they often see environmental wins alongside economic upsides. For instance, the Middlebury Institute of International Studies looked at this and found that compostable food service ware (CSFW) might even have positive Net Present Values over time, making it a good long-term bet (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, this gets complicated. Evidence coming out of Canada indicates that reusable packaging—the kind you actually wash and use again—can beat single-use compostable options on both cost and ecology, meaning how often you reuse it really matters (Snyder & Park, 2024). Plus, bioplastics and renewable resources support those global Sustainable Development Goals (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). But we have to be real: affordability, usability, and the current infrastructure present major roadblocks. In the Philippines, biodegradable materials look promising; one study showed they decompose in about a month, cutting plastic pollution (Yao et al., 2024). Innovations like StrawPlast, which mix straw fibers with bioplastics, promote a circular economy, which is great (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). But here’s the thing we keep seeing: biodegradable packaging costs more upfront because production and technology upgrades are needed, even if waste management costs drop later (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally in Zamboanga City, they reduced plastic use by switching, but durability, usability, and customer buy-in remain serious problems (Mohammad, 2024). These findings tell us that for a place like Mapúa MCM, we have to balance green goals with hard cash and how students behave. We recognize these constraints, but analyzing both the long-term payoff and the immediate pain is essential for seeing if this switch actually works on our campus.

We can guide the plastic-to-compostable switch at Mapúa MCM using two main theoretical ideas: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA lets us systematically check the costs of compostables against the payoffs—things like lower disposal bills, environmental gains, and a better campus image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For our canteen, this framework lets us figure out if the switch nets a positive value over time, even with expensive new containers. Then there’s TPB, which Ajzen cooked up (cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). What does TPB claim? Basically, whether someone acts depends on their attitude, what their peers think, and if they feel they can actually do it (p. 03). So, even if compostables make financial sense, if students find them inconvenient or just don't care about the environment, the whole effort fails. I think combining these theories is key. We get an economic reading *and* a social dynamic reading. That means we don't just check the ledger; we check the culture of the Mapúa MCM community to ensure the shift sticks. A complete picture.

Sustainable packaging gets a lot of talk lately, but I honestly think there are gaps, especially in Philippine schools. A lot of the models we read about come from other countries; they don't match our local economics, our limited infrastructure, or how Filipino people behave. For example, do we even have the bins needed to properly sort compostable waste here? Few studies apply behavioral theories like TPB specifically to how our faculty and students react to these initiatives. Plus, the canteen vendors—their concerns about cost and how long the containers last—get overlooked way too often. Reusable packaging is another option, but we don't see enough direct comparisons between that and compostable items in a university setting. We also need to look at how school rules or local laws either help or block these changes. Why aren't we asking more about the vendors?

This whole project aims to nail down if switching from plastic to compostable packaging is actually viable for the vendors long-term and what students and professors actually think about adopting this new practice at Mapúa MCM. We want to know how to implement this transition well, focusing not just on social acceptance but on the bottom line for the canteen operators. Our ultimate goal? To give a clear recommendation that guarantees the shift is financially sound *and* fully supported by the entire campus population. That contributes to regulating single-use products. A necessary step forward.
