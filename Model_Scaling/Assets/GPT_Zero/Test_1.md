The growing worry about plastic pollution pushes institutions hard to find better packaging options. University canteens, specifically, face heat to ditch single-use plastics; they add hugely to waste and emissions, you know (Solsona, 2024). Thinking about Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, switching from regular plastic food containers to compostable ones brings up major questions about cost and how truly sustainable it all is. Moving to compostable stuff isn't simple. It means juggling money matters, infrastructure readiness, and what customers actually think. Some research suggests compostable choices save money long-term because waste disposal costs drop (Kaur & Acid, 2020), yet schools might still balk at the high initial material expense. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, these details mean we have to check if the long-run perks beat the immediate financial and operating hurdles. Consumer feelings matter just as much. Studies show that while materials like biodegradable stuff encourage environmental care (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), success hinges on student awareness and actual participation. This creates a gap. Aligning what the institution tries to do with what consumers expect proves tough, since the gap between intent and action can kill the change (Solsona, 2024). This research concentrates mainly on analyzing the costs versus the benefits of this switch—plastic to compostable—in the Mapúa MCM canteen, looking closely at the money side, the environment, and how people behave. We, as student-researchers, see this as timely and essential research. It highlights how schools can lead in sustainability while facing down real barriers like cost and implementation difficulties.

International findings show that moving university canteens from plastic to compostable packaging offers both ecological and economic upsides. Research out of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies demonstrated that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can actually help institutions, often showing positive Net Present Values (NPVs), which makes it cost-effective over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, Canadian evidence suggests that reusable packaging—used repeatedly—might beat single-use compostable options both financially and environmentally, showing use frequency is key in sustainability checks (Snyder & Park, 2024). Moreover, other studies point out that bioplastics and renewable sourcing support green economic practices and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals; challenges, though, persist with affordability, usability, and the necessary infrastructure (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the push for compostable packaging looks good too, but needs a careful look at costs and how it gets put into action. Yao and colleagues (2024) found biodegradable stuff can break down in about a month, greatly cutting down plastic waste. Innovations like StrawPlast, mixing straw fibers with bioplastics, offer chances to promote a circular economy and cut environmental harm (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). But research emphasizes that biodegradable packaging materials often cost more than plastic because of production expenses and the need for new tech. Long-term savings, however, might come from lower waste management fees and meeting policy goals (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally, work in Zamboanga City shows that using plastic substitutes cut down consumption, yet issues with durability, usability, and customer acceptance remain big hurdles (Mohammad, 2024). Feedback from people involved indicates that while support for eco-friendly packaging exists, practical worries about strength, ease of use, and price act as real roadblocks. These results make it clear: for places like the Mapúa MCM canteen, shifting to compostable packaging means balancing green aims against money constraints and how students actually act. We get these issues, but analyzing both the long-term payoff and the short-term struggles seems vital to deciding if this change is workable and can last on campus.

Guiding the switch from plastic to compostable packaging at Mapua MCM needs two theoretical frameworks. The Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) works well here. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is also key. CBA lets us systematically compare the costs of compostable packaging against its gains—think lower waste fees, environmental wins, and a better school reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this framework helps us figure out if the move creates positive net value long-term, even with high material costs cropping up. At the same time, Ajzen’s TPB (1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) suggests that what a person intends to do depends on their attitude, social pressure, and perceived control (p. 03). TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging, what others expect, and how easy the change feels all influence whether students and consumers will back the shift. For instance, even if compostable stuff makes financial sense, consumer pushback from thinking it’s inconvenient or just not caring about the environment can derail the whole thing. Putting these theories together offers a complete model, blending economic checks with behavioral science. This combination makes sure the study addresses not just if the packaging is affordable, but also the social elements that determine if the change sticks and works in practice across the Mapua MCM community.

Sustainable packaging has grabbed attention recently; still, gaps exist in current research, especially concerning Philippine schools. A lot of existing work relies on international models, which might not accurately reflect local realities like economic status, limited infrastructure, or specific student behaviors at Mapúa MCM. For example, we don't know much about whether campuses have the needed support systems, like proper waste sorting and actual composting setups. Also, while behavioral ideas like the TPB get used a lot, few studies check how Filipino students and staff really see and react to these green efforts. The canteen vendors sometimes get ignored, though they drive implementation and worry about expense, durability, and supply chains. Reusable packaging is often brought up as another route, yet studies comparing its practicality against compostable options on campus remain scarce. We also need to look at how official policies and local rules either help or block these transitions.

This study sets out to figure out if switching from plastic to compostable packaging is practical. We want to check the long-term workability for vendors and gauge the attitudes, perceived social pressure, and perceived behavioral control of students and faculty when trying to adopt this green habit in the Mapúa MCM canteen. We seek to grasp how this change can roll out well on campus, considering social approval alongside the financial realities faced by canteen vendors. The main goal is giving a clearer picture that assures the shift is affordable and has the backing of the entire campus community, helping regulate single-use product consumption.
