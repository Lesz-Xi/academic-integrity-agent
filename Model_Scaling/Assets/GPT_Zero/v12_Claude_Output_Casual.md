Honestly, the whole situation with plastic pollution is putting a ton of pressure on schools to find better options for packaging. It's kinda crazy. Basically, school kitchens are dealing with this huge demand to cut down on single-use plastics, since they create so much waste and mess up the environment (Solsona, 2024). When you look at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, switching from regular plastic to compostable stuff brings up some big questions about money and if it's actually gonna last. Moving to compostable packaging isn't exactly simple, you know? It's about balancing the cost, getting everything set up, and seeing if people will actually use it. I guess even though some studies say compostable options can save money in the long run by cutting waste costs (Kaur & Acid, 2020), schools might still be hesitant because the upfront price is higher. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, that makes it really important to check if the long-term good stuff outweighs the immediate money problems. Also, how students feel about it matters a lot. Research shows that while eco-friendly stuff like biodegradable packaging helps people be more responsible (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), the actual success really depends on if students know about it and actually participate. So it's kind of a challenge to match up what the campus wants to do with what people actually expect, since there's often a gap between what people say and what they do (Solsona, 2024). This study is basically just looking at the costs and benefits of switching from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen, focusing on the money, the environment, behaviour, and all that other stuff. As student-researchers, we think this is pretty important, especially to show how schools like ours can lead the way in doing sustainable things while dealing with the reality of costs and getting started.

So, looking at studies from other countries, it shows that moving from plastic to compostable packaging in schools is actually good for both the planet and the budget. Research at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can help schools out and give good returns later on, making it a pretty solid long-term choice (Kaur & Acid, 2020). But then, evidence from Canada suggests that reusable packaging—using stuff more than once—might actually be cheaper and better for the environment than compostable stuff you just throw away. It just goes to show that how often you use something is a big deal when you're looking at what lasts (Snyder & Park, 2024). Plus, studies highlight that bioplastics and renewable resources support good economic practices and the UN's goals, though there are still issues with price and usability—and getting it all set up (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). Here in the Philippines, moving to compostable packaging looks promising too, but you gotta carefully look at the costs. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable stuff can break down in a month, which really cuts down on plastic mess. Same with things like StrawPlast, which mixes straw with bioplastics—it's a cool way to recycle and stop hurting the environment (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Still, studies warn that biodegradable packaging is often pricier than plastic because making it costs more and you need new tech, though you might save money later on waste management and staying in line with rules (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally, studies in Zamboanga City show that using plastic alternatives has lowered single-use plastic use, but there are still problems with recycling, breaking it down, and especially getting people to accept it (Mohammad, 2024). What we heard is that while people support green stuff, they're still worried about if it works, how much it costs, and all that other stuff. From what we've seen, for places like the Mapúa MCM canteen, switching to compostable packaging means balancing green plans with the budget and how people actually act. As student-researchers, we get the limits but think analyzing the long-term wins and short-term hassles is key to seeing if this switch is doable and sustainable on campus.

Basically, switching from plastic to compostable packaging at Mapúa MCM can be guided by two main ideas: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The Cost-Benefit Analysis is just a way to look at the costs of compostable packaging against the benefits—like spending less on waste, helping the environment, and making the school look good (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this helps us see if the switch can actually make sense financially in the long run, even with the higher material costs. At same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)—which Ajzen came up with (1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024)—says that "an individual's intention to engage in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control." Honestly, it just means that how people feel about compostable packaging, what they think others expect, and how easy it is to do, changes whether they'll actually support the switch. Like, even if compostable packaging makes money sense, if people think it's a hassle or don't care about the environment, it won't work. Together, these theories give us a setup that mixes money stuff with how people act. This mix ensures the study doesn't just look at if we can afford it, but also looks at the social side that decides if the change will actually stick at Mapúa MCM.

Sustainable packaging has been getting a lot of attention lately, but there's still a lot we don't know, especially in Philippine schools. A lot of studies follow international models, which don't really fit the money situation, setup limits, or how people act in local universities like Mapúa MCM. For example, nobody's really checked if campuses have the right systems for compostable packaging, like waste segregation or composting spots. Plus, while behavioral theories like the TPB are used a lot, not many studies have really looked at how Filipino students and teachers feel about sustainable packaging. Vendors often get ignored too, even though they're the ones doing the work and worrying about cost, supply, and durability. To be fair, reusable packaging gets talked about a lot as an option, but there aren't many studies checking if it's practical alongside compostable stuff on campus. We also need to see how school rules and local laws help or hurt these changes. Anyway, this study aims to see if switching from plastic to compostable packaging is actually doable by looking at the long-term reality for vendors and checking how students and professors feel about it at the Mapúa MCM canteen. We want to understand how this transition can actually happen on campus, considering social acceptance and the money side for vendors. The goal is just to get a better understanding to make sure the shift makes financial sense and gets support from the whole campus to help cut down on single-use stuff.
