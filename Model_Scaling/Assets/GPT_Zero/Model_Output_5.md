The intensifying environmental apprehension regarding plastic waste—a concern growing across sectors—has placed considerable strain on institutions to seek out packaging alternatives that show greater sustainability. University food services, in particular, confront rising expectations to curtail their use of disposable plastics, materials heavily implicated in waste accumulation and greenhouse gas generation (Solsona, 2024). For Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, contemplating a shift away from standard plastics toward compostable food containers forces consideration of central issues: cost viability and true long-term ecological returns. Transitioning to compostables is hardly a simple flip; it demands a careful calibration among fiscal realities, infrastructure preparedness, and how consumers react. While some research supports the notion that compostable products might yield eventual savings through lower disposal fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020), the initial material outlay can still cause institutional hesitation. In the specific context of the Mapúa MCM canteen, these variables compel an assessment of whether projected long-term gains justify the immediate operational and financial hurdles. Consumer attitudes, too, carry equal weight. Biodegradable material use—which suggests environmental responsibility (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025)—only succeeds if students actively recognize and participate in the process. This creates friction—an alignment problem where institutional aims might outpace actual user commitment, thus limiting the initiative's success (Solsona, 2024). Our inquiry, therefore, centers on a cost-benefit assessment for the Mapúa MCM canteen’s move from plastic to compostable containers, focusing equally on the financial, environmental, and behavioral aspects of this adjustment. We, as student-researchers, find this problem immediately relevant, stressing how academic centers can model sustainable action while confronting the hard facts of implementation barriers.

Global data suggest that exchanging conventional plastics for compostable alternatives in campus dining often yields both environmental uplift and economic advantage. A study at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, for instance, demonstrated that compostable food service ware (CSFW) could produce positive Net Present Values (NPVs) for the host institutions, positioning it as a cost-effective strategy over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, other evidence—from Canada, specifically—indicates that reusable containers, once cycled through enough times, surpass single-use compostables both financially and ecologically, making use frequency a key metric in sustainability evaluations (Snyder & Park, 2024). Bioplastics derived from renewable sources can certainly align with economic principles and UN Sustainable Development Goals, yet affordability, ease of use, and necessary infrastructure remain sticking points (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippine setting, this shift also looks promising but demands a close look at costs and execution details. Yao et al. (2024) documented that biodegradable options can break down in under a month, sharply cutting plastic pollution. Further, innovations like StrawPlast, which incorporate straw fibers into bioplastics, present avenues for circular economies (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Nevertheless, the persistent theme is material expense—biodegradable supplies generally cost more upfront due to manufacturing demands and technological updates, even if long-term savings appear through reduced waste costs and policy compliance (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally, studies in Zamboanga City confirm a reduction in plastic use after adopting alternatives, but durability, usability, and general customer approval remain obstacles (Mohammad, 2024). These findings point toward a necessary balancing act for university dining halls, Mapúa MCM included: environmental goals must square off against financial limits and actual student conduct. We see these constraints. A critical analysis of short-term problems versus long-term returns will determine feasibility here.

Guiding the Mapúa MCM transition—from plastic to compostable materials—can be done effectively by applying two theoretical perspectives: Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The CBA framework offers a systematic comparison: weighing the costs of compostables against benefits like lower disposal expenditure, environmental gains, and a better institutional image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this structure allows us to determine if the change offers a positive net value down the line, even with higher initial material costs. Simultaneously, the Theory of Planned Behavior—Ajzen’s model (1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024)—suggests that behavior intention stems from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control (p. 03). TPB helps explain how consumer outlooks on compostables, social pressure, and perceived ease of change affect willingness to support the switch. Take this example: compostables might make economic sense, but pushback from users perceiving inconvenience or simply not caring about the environment could derail the entire effort. These two theories combine well. They create a structure that examines not just if the packaging is financially practical, but also the social currents determining if the change sticks. A holistic view.

Sustainable packaging attracts more focus recently; however, significant research deficits persist, specifically within the Philippine educational sphere. Much of the existing literature draws from international examples—models that might not accurately reflect local infrastructure limits, economic environments, and distinct behavioral patterns found at a place like Mapúa MCM. Limited investigation exists, for example, into whether the campus possesses the requisite support systems—waste segregation, proper composting facilities. Furthermore, while behavioral theories like TPB are often cited, few analyses probe how Filipino students and faculty actually react to these specific sustainability pushes. Canteen vendors, though central to implementation, frequently get overlooked; their concerns about durability, usability, and cost are often sidelined. Reusables are another alternative often discussed, but empirical comparisons evaluating their practicality alongside compostables in a campus setting remain scarce. We also need to examine the influence of local rules and institutional policies—how they either aid or impede these transitions.

This investigation seeks to pin down the feasibility of moving from plastic to compostable containers by gauging the long-term viability for vendors and assessing the attitudes, social expectations, and perceived control of students and faculty over adopting this new practice at the Mapúa MCM canteen. We aim to map out an effective implementation strategy, one that integrates social acceptance with the economic realities faced by canteen vendors. The goal? To clarify the pathway toward a shift that is both financially sound and fully backed by the entire campus community, helping regulate those single-use items. A final audit.
