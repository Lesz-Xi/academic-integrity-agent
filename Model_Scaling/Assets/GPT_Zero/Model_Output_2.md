The rising global concern regarding plastic waste exerts substantial pressure on organizations to seek out packaging alternatives that are more environmentally sound. Specifically, university cafeterias are facing escalating expectations to lessen their dependence on disposable plastics, given these items contribute heavily to waste buildup and greenhouse gas output (Solsona, 2024). Considering Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, the move away from standard plastic food containers toward materials that can compost raises core questions surrounding both cost effectiveness and enduring sustainability. Adopting compostable containers is never a simple fix; it forces a balancing act between budgetary realities, infrastructure preparedness, and how consumers will react. Though some research suggests that compostable choices might yield cost reductions over time by lowering disposal fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions often pause because the initial material expense is greater. For the Mapúa MCM canteen specifically, these variables make it essential to check if eventual gains justify the immediate financial strain and operational hurdles. Just as vital are the attitudes and actions of the consumers concerning compostable options. Data indicates that while eco-friendly substances like biodegradable packaging encourage environmental awareness (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), success hinges on student comprehension and active support. This creates a difficulty: aligning what the institution tries to do with what consumers actually expect. Gaps between intent and action can sabotage the entire shift (Solsona, 2024). Our research therefore focuses on a cost-benefit assessment of switching from plastic to compostable items within the Mapúa MCM cafeteria, paying close attention to the financial, ecological, and behavioral angles of the change. We, as student-researchers, view this problem as both urgent and necessary, particularly in showing how educational bodies can set an example for adopting green methods while still dealing with the concrete issues of price and implementation hurdles.

Global scholarship shows that transitioning university dining services from plastics to compostable materials offers both ecological and fiscal upsides. Research conducted at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies revealed that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can actually benefit the institutions, often showing positive Net Present Values (NPVs), meaning it becomes economically sound over the long run (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, evidence from Canada suggests that reusable containers, when cycled many times, might prove both cheaper and greener than single-use compostable options, indicating that usage frequency plays a large role in assessing sustainability (Snyder & Park, 2024). Furthermore, specific studies emphasize that bioplastics and materials derived from renewable sources align with sound economic patterns and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, even if issues of affordability, practical use, and necessary infrastructure persist (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippine setting, the push toward compostable solutions shows promise too, yet it needs a careful look at costs and how to roll it out. Yao et al. (2024) reported that biodegradable composites can break down in about a month, substantially cutting down on plastic pollution. Similarly, new materials like StrawPlast, which merges straw elements with bioplastics, open avenues for advancing a circular economy and cutting environmental harm (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Nonetheless, various reports stress that biodegradable packaging is usually pricier than traditional plastic because of manufacturing complexity and the need for newer equipment, although future savings might come from lower waste management fees and better alignment with green mandates (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally, investigations in Zamboanga City confirm that using plastic replacements has successfully lowered single-use plastic volume, but hurdles remain concerning recyclability, true biodegradability, and customer buy-in (Mohammad, 2024). Feedback from involved parties suggests that while backing for eco-friendly packaging exists, real-world worries about durability, ease of use, and expense remain major obstacles. These observations point to the fact that for places like university dining halls—including Mapúa MCM—the move needs to balance environmental aims against fiscal truth and how people act. We, the student-researchers, understand these limits. Still, we feel analyzing both the long-term wins and the immediate difficulties is essential to judge if this change is actually possible and maintainable on campus.

Guiding the shift from plastic to compostable containers at Mapua MCM needs two conceptual anchors: the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The CBA offers a structured comparison of the costs associated with compostable goods against their prospective rewards, such as lower waste-handling bills, ecological improvements, and a better institutional image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). Applied to the Mapúa MCM cafeteria, this lens permits an assessment of whether the switch can create positive net value long-term, even when material costs are initially higher. Simultaneously, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), developed by Ajzen (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024), proposes that an individual’s choice to act is shaped by their attitudes, what they perceive others expect, and their perceived ease of action (p. 03). The TPB helps explain how student and consumer attitudes toward compostable items, perceived social pressures, and how simple they think the change will be all influence their willingness to participate. For instance, even if the packaging makes financial sense, opposition from consumers based on perceived inconvenience or a lack of care for green issues could stall the rollout. Merged, these theories construct a comprehensive model integrating economic reckoning with behavioral understanding. This dual approach assures the research doesn't just assess financial viability but also accounts for the social factors determining if the change sticks and works in the Mapua MCM environment.

Sustainable packaging has recently gained more attention. Still, several knowledge gaps persist, especially concerning Philippine educational centers. Many current studies depend on international benchmarks that might not accurately reflect the local financial situations, infrastructure limits, and behavioral trends found at schools like Mapúa MCM. For example, there’s little exploration into whether campuses possess the necessary support structures for compostables—think proper waste sorting and composting sites. Also, behavioral models like the TPB are widely used, but few pieces of work explore how Filipino students and faculty actually react to these green pushes. The vendors’ role often gets ignored, despite them being key to execution and holding concerns about price, toughness, and supply. Reusable packaging is frequently raised as a smart alternative, yet reports contrasting its real-world use against compostables in campus settings are rare. We also need a look at how institutional rules or local codes either push or block these transitions.

This investigation seeks to confirm the feasibility of moving from plastic to compostable containers. It will gauge long-term viability for vendors and evaluate the attitudes, social pressures, and perceived control of students and faculty regarding this sustainable shift at the Mapúa MCM canteen. The aim is understanding how to make the change work on campus—not just socially, but economically for the vendors too. The final goal is a clearer picture that ensures the switch is both budget-friendly and fully backed by the entire campus population, helping control the use of disposable items.
