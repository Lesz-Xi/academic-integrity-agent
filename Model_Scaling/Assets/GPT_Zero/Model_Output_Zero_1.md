The increasing global worry about plastic trash has really pushed institutions toward exploring more sustainable packaging options. University canteens, specifically, face growing pressure to drop single-use plastics, which dump huge amounts of waste and emissions into the atmosphere (Solsona, 2024). Within Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, the idea of switching from standard plastic food containers to compostable ones brings up key questions regarding cost-effectiveness and how long the benefits last. Moving to compostable packaging isn't simple. It means balancing money matters, whether the infrastructure is ready, and if students will even use it. Some research suggests compostable options save money long-term by cutting waste fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, hesitation often centers on the higher price of the materials themselves. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, these tensions—financial versus long-term payoff—demand close inspection. Equally significant are how students think and act around compostable stuff. While sustainable materials like biodegradable options signal environmental care (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), true success hinges on student awareness and actual participation. This creates a gap—aligning what the school tries to do with what consumers actually do, since intention often fails to translate into action (Solsona, 2024). This investigation, therefore, centers on a cost-benefit assessment for the Mapúa MCM canteen's switch, looking hard at the money side, the environment, and student behavior. As student-researchers, we see this problem as essential right now—it shows how schools can lead sustainability efforts while dealing with the tough realities of budget and implementation.

International findings demonstrate that moving university canteens from plastic to compostable containers offers both ecological and financial upsides. Take the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, for instance; their work showed that compostable food service ware (CSFW) resulted in positive Net Present Values (NPVs), marking it a smart long-term financial choice (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Yet, data from Canada presents a different angle. Reusable packaging, when utilized many times, often beats single-use compostable options for cost and environmental benefit, showing use frequency matters in sustainability ratings (Snyder & Park, 2024). Then there’s the broader context. Bioplastics and renewable resources align with economic practices and UN Sustainable Development Goals—but affordability, usability, and the need for new infrastructure remain real obstacles (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, making this switch looks promising, yet costs and how to actually pull it off need serious review. Yao et al. (2024) noted that biodegradable goods break down in about a month, slashing plastic pollution. Innovations, too, like StrawPlast—which merges straw fibers with bioplastics—support a circular economy, cutting down environmental harm (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Still, reports emphasize that these biodegradable containers cost more upfront due to production needs and tech upgrades, though reduced waste management expenses might balance things out later (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally, studies in Zamboanga City confirm plastic reduction after adopting alternatives, but durability, usability, and student buy-in remain major issues (Mohammad, 2024). These points show that for any campus canteen—Mapúa MCM included—the shift requires balancing green goals against budget constraints and everyday student actions. We recognize these hurdles—and believe analyzing short-term difficulties alongside long-term gains is key to judging the viability of this campus change.

Guiding the move from plastic to compostable containers at Mapua MCM rests on two theoretical concepts: Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA offers a systematic way to compare the expenses of compostable goods against their potential returns—things like lower trash fees, environmental wins, and a better school image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this structure lets us ask: does the switch create positive net value over time, even if the initial material costs are steep? Simultaneously, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)—Ajzen’s idea (1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024)—posits that behavior intention stems from attitudes, what others expect, and what control a person feels they have (p. 03). TPB explains how student feelings, social pressure, and how easy the switch seems influence their willingness to support it. For example, even if compostable packaging makes financial sense, resistance from consumers—maybe they find it inconvenient or just don't care that much—can derail the whole project. Together, these theories give us a complete structure: one that merges economic review with behavioral understanding. This combination ensures we analyze not only the financial workability but also the social currents that determine if the change sticks in the Mapua MCM community.

Sustainable packaging has gained attention recently. Still, gaps exist, especially in Philippine schools. Many current studies rely on international situations that don't quite match local economic realities, infrastructure limits, or student behaviors found at Mapúa MCM. For instance, little investigation covers whether campuses have the actual systems needed to manage compostable goods—think waste sorting and composting sites. Behavioral theories like TPB get used a lot, but few look at how Filipino faculty and students actually react to these green packaging pushes. Canteen operators often get overlooked, too; their concerns about cost, sturdiness, and supply chain are real. Reusable packaging is often touted as an answer, yet studies comparing it directly to compostable options on campus are rare. We also need to see how local rules and school policies either help or block these shifts. This study aims to see if switching from plastic to compostable packaging is viable long-term for vendors, and to gauge the attitudes, social pressure, and perceived control students and professors feel about adopting this sustainable habit at the Mapúa MCM canteen. We want to know the best path for implementation—considering social acceptance *and* the economic impact on vendors. The ultimate goal: generate a clear understanding that guarantees the shift is sound financially and supported campus-wide, helping regulate single-use items. A good outcome.
