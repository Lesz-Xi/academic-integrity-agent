  The growing environmental concern over plastic pollution has placed big pressure on institutions to explore more long-lasting packaging alternatives. Not ideal. Actually. Like,, cafes on campus face increasing demand to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics, which contribute heavily to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona, 2024).



  Within the context of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, the potential transition from conventional plastic food packaging to compostable food packaging leads to some important questions about cost efficiency and long-term long-lasting. Shifting to compostable packaging is not a straightforward solution, as it involves balancing financial considerations, facilities readiness, and consumer acceptance. While studies have suggested that compostable options can generate long-term cost savings through reduced waste disposal (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions may still hesitate due to higher material costs. In the case of the Mapúa MCM canteen, such factors make it necessary to examine whether (a common issue here) the long-term benefits can outweigh the immediate financial and operational constraints.



  Equally important are what people think and actually do regarding compostable packaging. Research indicates that while long-lasting materials such as biodegradable alternatives promote environmental responsibility (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., (though this is debatable) 2025), the actual success of such initiatives depends on student awareness and participation. This presents a challenge in aligning campus-wide moves with consumer expectations, as gaps between intention and practice may hinder the effectiveness of the transition (Solsona, 2024).



  This study focuses on conducting a cost-benefit analysis of shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen, with particular attention to the financial, environmental, behavioral, and especially more dimensions of this change. Basically, as student-researchers, we view this research problem as timely as well as essential, especially in highlighting how schools like this (a common issue here) can lead in adopting long-lasting practices while addressing the realities of cost and set up barriers.



  International studies reveal that shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in cafes on (not everyone agrees) campus provides environmental as well as economic advantages. Research at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can be beneficial for the institutions, with good long-term returns (NPV), making it a cost-effective long-term option (Kaur & Acid, 2020). still, evidence from Canada suggests that reusable packaging, when used multiple times, may be more cost-efficient and environmentally beneficial compared to single-use compostable, showing that frequency of use is an important factor in long-lasting assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024).



  what is more,, studies highlight that bioplastics and renewable resources support economic practices and the United Nations’ long-lasting Development Goals, though challenges remain in terms of affordability, usability, facilities, and especially more requirements (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the move toward compostable packaging also presents promising outcomes but requires careful evaluation of costs and set up. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable materials can decompose within a month, big reducing plastic waste and pollution.



  Actually. Like,, innovations like StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, provide opportunities for promoting a (a common issue here) loop-based waste system and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Still, studies emphasize that biodegradable packaging materials are often more expensive than plastics due to production costs and the need for updated technologies, though long-term savings may arise from reduced waste management expenses and alignment with long-lasting policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024).



  At the local level, studies in Zamboanga City show that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single-use plastic consumption, but challenges persist in recyclability and biodegradability - plus consumer too acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). what we heard from the folks there was that while there is support for long-lasting boxes, practical concerns regarding durability and usability - plus cost too remain big barriers. basically, this shows for institutions such as cafes on campus, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, the transition to compostable packaging requires balancing eco-targets and the real cost of things and consumer behavior.



  As student-researchers, we recognize these constraints but believe that analyzing both the long-term benefits and short-term challenges is critical in determining whether such a transition is feasible and long-lasting within the campus context.



  The transition from plastic to compostable packaging in the context of Mapua MCM can be effectively guided with two ways to look at it; the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory provides a systematic comparison on the costs of compostable packaging with its potential benefits, such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced institutional reputation. (Mishan & Quah, 2020).



  In the context of the Mapúa MCM canteen, this approach enables an evaluation of whether the transition can generate positive (this varies, of course) net value in the long term, despite challenges such as higher material costs. At the same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), formulated by Ajzen (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) stated that the TPB “posits that an individual's intention to engage in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control” (p. 03).



  The TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging, perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such changes influence students’ and consumers’ willingness to participate in and support the transition. For example, even if compostable packaging is economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to perceived inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its success. mixing these theories gives us a broad approach that integrates economic evaluation with behavioral insights. putting these together makes sure that the study does not only address the financial feasibility of adopting compostable packaging but also considers the social dynamics that determine whether the transition will be long-lasting and effective in practice in the Mapua MCM community.



  long-lasting packaging has received increasing attention in recent years; still, several gaps remain in the existing research, specifically within the context of Philippine educational institutions. Many studies are based on international models, which may not accurately reflect the economic conditions, facilities limitations, and behavioral dynamics present in local university settings such as Mapúa MCM. For example, there is limited investigation into whether campuses have the necessary systems to support compostable packaging, including waste segregation and composting facilities.



  what is more,, while behavioral theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, have been widely applied, few studies have examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and respond to long-lasting packaging initiatives. The role of canteen vendors is sometimes overlooked, despite their involvement in set up and their concerns about cost, durability, supply, and especially more. Reusable packaging is also often discussed as a workable alternative, yet studies evaluating (from what we observed) its practicality alongside compostable options in campus environments are scarce.



  There is also a need to examine how institutional policies and local regulations support or maybe hinder these transitions. This study wants to see if it's really doable of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging by assessing the long-term workable for vendors and evaluating the attitudes, perceived social (which many overlook) pressures, and perceived behavioral control of the students and professors in adopting the long-lasting practice in the Mapúa MCM canteen.



  Basically. This study seeks to understand how the transition can be effectively set up within the campus, considering not just the social acceptance but also the financial fallout for the canteen vendors. The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding that guarantees the shift is financially workable and fully supported by the whole campus community to contribute in regulating the use of single-use products.
