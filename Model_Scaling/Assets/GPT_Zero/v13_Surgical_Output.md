The growing environmental concern over plastic pollution has placed major
pressure on institutions to explore more green packaging alternatives. Not ideal. actually,,
cafes on campus face increasing demand to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics,
which contribute heavily to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona,
2024). looking at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, trying to switch
from conventional plastic food packaging to compostable food packaging makes us ask some tough things about cost efficiency and long-term green. Shifting to compostable
packaging is not a straightforward solution, as it involves balancing financial
considerations, basics readiness, and consumer acceptance. While studies have
suggested that compostable options can generate long-term cost savings through reduced
waste disposal (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions may still hesitate due to higher material
costs. In the case of the Mapúa MCM canteen, such factors make it necessary to examine
whether the long-term benefits can outweigh the immediate financial and operational
constraints. Equally important are how students feel and act regarding
compostable packaging. Research indicates that while green materials such as
biodegradable alternatives promote environmental responsibility (Giordano & Mariani,
2024; Daramola et al., 2025), the actual success of such initiatives depends on student
awareness and participation. This presents a challenge in aligning campus-wide moves with
consumer expectations, as gaps between intention and practice may hinder the effectiveness
of the transition (Solsona, 2024). This study focuses on conducting a cost-benefit analysis
of shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen, with
particular attention to the financial, environmental, behavioral, and really more dimensions of this
4
change. As student-researchers, we view this research problem as timely plus essential,
especially in highlighting how schools like this can lead in adopting green
practices while addressing the realities of cost and put in place barriers. International studies reveal that shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in
cafes on campus provides environmental plus economic advantages. Research at the
Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that compostable food service ware
(CSFW) can be beneficial for the institutions, with signs that it makes sense financially,
making it a cost-effective long-term option (Kaur & Acid, 2020). However, evidence from
Canada suggests that reusable packaging, when used multiple times, may be more cost-
efficient and environmentally beneficial compared to single-use compostable, showing that
frequency of use is an important factor in green assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024). what is more,, studies highlight that bioplastics and renewable resources support economic
practices and the United Nations’ green Development Goals, though challenges
remain in terms of affordability and usability - plus basics too requirements (Ikechukwu,
2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the move toward compostable packaging
also presents promising outcomes but requires careful evaluation of costs and
put in place. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable materials can decompose
within a month, major reducing plastic waste and pollution. Similarly, innovations
like StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, provide opportunities for
promoting a loop-based waste system and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano &
Mariani, 2024). Still, studies emphasize that biodegradable packaging materials are often
more expensive than plastics due to production costs and the need for updated technologies,
though long-term savings (worth mentioning) may arise from reduced waste management expenses and
5
alignment with green policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). At the local
level, studies in Zamboanga City show that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single-
use plastic consumption, but challenges persist in recyclability and biodegradability - plus consumer too acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). people told us that while there
is support for green storage stuff, practical concerns (worth mentioning) regarding durability, usability, cost, and especially more remain major barriers. what we found was for institutions
such as cafes on campus, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, the transition to
compostable (a tricky point) packaging requires balancing eco-targets and the real cost of things and
consumer behavior. As student-researchers, we recognize these constraints but believe that
analyzing both the long-term benefits and short-term challenges is critical (this varies, of course) in determining
whether such a transition is feasible and green within the campus context. The transition from plastic to compostable packaging in the context of Mapua MCM
can be effectively guided with two ideas that guide us; the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory
(CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory
provides a systematic comparison on the costs of compostable packaging with its potential
benefits, such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced
institutional reputation. (Mishan & Quah, 2020). In the context of the Mapúa MCM
canteen, this approach enables an evaluation of whether the transition can generate
positive (a tricky point) net value in the long term, despite challenges such as higher material costs. At the
same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), formulated by Ajzen (1991, as cited in
Sarmah & Singh, 2024) stated that the TPB “posits that an individual's intention to engage
in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived
behavioral control” (p. 03). The TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging,
6
perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such changes influence students’
and consumers’ willingness to participate in and support the transition. For example, even
if compostable packaging is economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to
perceived inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its
success. mixing these theories gives us a broad approach that integrates economic
evaluation with behavioral insights. putting these together makes sure that the study does not only
address the financial feasibility of adopting compostable packaging but also considers the
social dynamics (worth mentioning) that determine whether the transition will be green and effective in
practice in the Mapua MCM community. green packaging has been talked about a lot more lately; however,
several gaps remain in the (worth mentioning) existing research, In particular within the context of Philippine
educational institutions. lots of studies use international models, but they don't really
accurately reflect the economic conditions, basics limitations, and behavioral
dynamics present in local university settings such as Mapúa MCM. For example, there is
limited investigation into whether campuses have the necessary systems to support
compostable packaging, including waste segregation and composting facilities. what is more,, while behavioral theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, have been
widely applied, few studies have examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and
respond to green packaging initiatives. The role of canteen vendors is sometimes
overlooked, despite their involvement in put in place (at least in our context) and their concerns about cost, durability, supply, and really more. Reusable packaging is also often discussed as a doable alternative,
yet studies evaluating its practicality alongside compostable options in campus
7
environments are scarce. There is also a need to examine how institutional policies and
local regulations support or maybe hinder these transitions. This study is trying to see if it actually makes sense of transitioning from plastic to
compostable packaging by assessing the long-term doable for vendors and evaluating the
attitudes, perceived social pressures, and perceived behavioral control of the students and
professors in adopting the green practice in the Mapúa MCM canteen. This study
seeks to understand how the transition can be effectively put in place within the campus,
considering not just the social acceptance but also the financial fallout for the
canteen vendors. The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding that guarantees
the shift is financially doable and fully supported by the whole campus community to
contribute in regulating the use of single-use products.
