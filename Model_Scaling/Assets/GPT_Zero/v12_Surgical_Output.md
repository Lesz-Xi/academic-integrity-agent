The growing environmental concern over plastic pollution has placed notable pressure on institutions to explore more long-lasting packaging alternatives. Depends. Like,, school kitchens face increasing demand to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics, which contribute heavily to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona, 2024). Within the context of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, the potential transition from conventional plastic food packaging to compostable food packaging raises critical questions about cost efficiency and long-term long-lasting. **Shifting to compostable packaging is not a straightforward solution, as it involves balancing financial considerations, setup readiness, and consumer acceptance.** While studies have suggested that compostable options can generate (this varies, of course) long-term cost savings through reduced waste disposal (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions may still hesitate due to higher material costs. In the case of the Mapúa MCM canteen, such factors make it necessary to examine whether the long-term benefits can outweigh the immediate financial and operational constraints. Equally important are how students feel and act regarding compostable packaging. **Research indicates that while long-lasting materials such as biodegradable alternatives promote environmental responsibility (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), the actual success of such initiatives depends on student awareness and participation.** **This presents a challenge in aligning campus-wide moves with consumer expectations, as gaps between intention and practice may hinder the effectiveness of the transition (Solsona, 2024).** This study focuses on conducting a cost-benefit analysis of shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen, with particular attention to the financial, environmental, behavioral, and even more dimensions of this 4 change. **As student-researchers, we view this research problem as both timely and essential, especially in highlighting how schools like this can lead in adopting long-lasting practices while addressing the realities of cost and start barriers.**
International studies reveal that shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in school kitchens provides both environmental and economic advantages. **Research at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can be beneficial for the institutions, with good long-term returns (NPV), making it a cost-effective long-term option (Kaur & Acid, 2020).** **However, evidence from Canada suggests that reusable packaging, when used multiple times, may be more cost-efficient and environmentally beneficial compared to single-use compostable, showing that frequency of use is an important factor in long-lasting assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024).** plus,, studies highlight that bioplastics and renewable resources support economic practices and the United Nations’ long-lasting Development Goals, though challenges remain in terms of affordability and usability - plus setup too requirements (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the move toward compostable packaging also presents promising outcomes but requires careful evaluation of costs and start. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable materials can decompose within a month, notable reducing plastic waste and pollution. **Similarly, innovations like StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, provide opportunities for promoting a recycling-focused setup and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano & Mariani, 2024).** **Still, studies emphasize that biodegradable packaging materials are often more expensive than plastics due to production costs and the need for updated technologies, though long-term savings may arise from reduced waste management expenses and 5 alignment with long-lasting policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024).** **At the local level, studies in Zamboanga City show that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single-use plastic consumption, but challenges persist in recyclability, biodegradability, consumer, and especially more acceptance (Mohammad, 2024).** what we heard from the folks there was that while there is support for green storage stuff, practical concerns regarding durability, usability, cost, and even more remain notable barriers. from what we saw, for institutions such as school kitchens, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, the transition to compostable packaging requires balancing green plans versus how much money they actually have and consumer behavior. **As student-researchers, we recognize these constraints but believe that analyzing both the long-term benefits and short-term challenges is critical in determining whether such a transition is feasible and long-lasting within the campus context.**
The transition from plastic to compostable packaging in (this varies, of course) the context of Mapua MCM can be effectively guided with two ways to look at it; the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory provides a systematic comparison on the costs of compostable packaging with its potential benefits, (though this is debatable) such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced institutional reputation. (Mishan & Quah, 2020). In the context of the Mapúa MCM canteen, this setup enables an evaluation of whether the transition can generate (though this is debatable) positive net value in the long term, despite challenges such as higher material costs. At the same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), formulated by Ajzen (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) stated that the TPB “posits that an individual's intention to engage in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control” (p. 03). The TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging, 6 perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such changes influence students’ and consumers’ willingness to participate in and support the transition. For example, even if compostable packaging is economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to perceived inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its success. Together, these theories provide a broad setup that integrates economic evaluation with behavioral insights. **The combination ensures that the study does not only address the financial feasibility of adopting compostable packaging but also considers the social dynamics that determine whether the transition will be long-lasting and effective in practice in the Mapua MCM community.**
long-lasting packaging has received increasing attention in recent years; however, several gaps remain in the existing research, Like within the context of Philippine educational institutions. **Many studies are based on international models, which may not accurately reflect the economic conditions, setup limitations, and behavioral dynamics present in local university settings such as Mapúa MCM.** For example, there is limited investigation into whether campuses have the necessary systems to support compostable packaging, including waste segregation and composting facilities. plus,, while behavioral theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, have been widely applied, few studies have (to be fair) examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and respond to long-lasting packaging initiatives. The role of canteen vendors is sometimes overlooked, despite their involvement in start (often ignored) and their concerns about cost, durability, supply, and really more. Reusable packaging is also often discussed as a realistic alternative, yet studies evaluating its practicality alongside compostable options in campus 7 environments are scarce. There is also a need to examine how institutional policies and local regulations either support or hinder these transitions. **This study aims to determine the feasibility of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging by assessing the long-term realistic for vendors and evaluating the attitudes, perceived social pressures, and perceived behavioral control of the students and professors in adopting the long-lasting practice in the Mapúa MCM canteen.** **This study seeks to understand how the transition can be effectively start within the campus, considering not just the social acceptance but also the money side of things for the canteen vendors.** The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding that guarantees the shift is financially realistic and fully supported by the whole campus community to contribute in regulating the use of single-use products.
