The growing worry about plastic pollution pushes institutions hard to find better packaging options. University canteens, specifically, face heat to ditch single-use plastics; they add hugely to waste and emissions, you know (Solsona, 2024). Thinking about Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, switching from regular plastic food containers to compostable ones brings up major questions about cost and how truly sustainable it all is. Moving to compostable stuff isn't simple. It means juggling money matters, infrastructure readiness, and what customers actually think. Some research suggests compostable choices save money long-term because waste disposal costs drop (Kaur & Acid, 2020), yet schools might still balk at the high initial material expense. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, these details mean we have to check if the long-run perks beat the immediate financial and operating hurdles. Consumer feelings matter just as much. Studies show that while materials like biodegradable stuff encourage environmental care (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), success hinges on student awareness and actual participation. This creates a gap. Aligning what the institution tries to do with what consumers expect proves tough, since the gap between intent and action can kill the change (Solsona, 2024). This research concentrates mainly on analyzing the costs versus the benefits of this switch—plastic to compostable—in the Mapúa MCM canteen, looking closely at the money side, the environment, and how people behave. We, as student-researchers, see this as timely and essential research. It highlights how schools can lead in sustainability while facing down real barriers like cost and implementation difficulties.

The mounting pressure regarding plastic pollution is forcing institutions to seek out alternative packaging methods. University cafeterias, in particular, are under scrutiny to eliminate single-use plastics, given their contribution to waste streams and emissions (Solsona, 2024). For Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, transitioning its food service from conventional plastic containers to compostable alternatives introduces significant complexities concerning both expense and the actual viability of the sustainability claim. Shifting to compostable materials is seldom straightforward. It involves balancing financial constraints, assessing existing infrastructure capabilities, and gauging the prevailing customer sentiment. Some literature indicates potential long-term savings through reduced waste management fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020), yet the initial capital outlay for materials often presents an institutional deterrent. For the Mapúa MCM canteen specifically, these variables necessitate a detailed assessment to determine if projected long-term gains outweigh immediate operational and fiscal obstacles. Consumer perception is equally important. While surveys confirm that embracing biodegradable options can foster environmental concern (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), successful adoption depends heavily on adequate student education and consistent behavioral compliance. I think this reveals a crucial gap. Aligning institutional mandates with consumer expectation remains difficult, as the divergence between stated intent and actual practice can derail change efforts (Solsona, 2024). What happens when we actually try? This research centers on a comparative analysis of the costs versus the benefits of implementing this plastic-to-compostable conversion within the Mapúa MCM canteen setting, focusing specifically on financial metrics, environmental impact modeling, and behavioral economics. We see this study as very timely. Why wouldn't we study it? It clarifies the leadership role schools can assume in sustainability while confronting tangible barriers like implementation difficulty and immediate cost.
