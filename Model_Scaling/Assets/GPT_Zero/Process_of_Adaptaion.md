Given all of those nuanced and constraint from GPTZero AI Detection. Here's my thought process of how we can solved this fundamental problems:

1. Is it possible to create a systematic plan for our model in order for it to learn the rules and limits towrards: Anchoring facts -> transformation signature -> vocabulary limits -> Structural limits ?
2. Can it become more intelligent and rational enough to suggest that this subject x and y needs human assertion/control?
3. Can we teach it to learn and adapt any unknown input data without degrading it's own trained data?
4. Can we use a web search tools (or any tools) in order for it to have a breaking point or a moment of thinking process for the sake of not diving directly on producing outputs?
5. Can we teach it to have it's own sophisticated rules with reinforcement learning across all known data and unknown incoming data (adaptation)?
