The mounting environmental concern regarding plastic waste creates substantial institutional pressure to investigate more sustainable packaging options. University dining halls, in particular, face rising expectations to decrease their dependence on disposable plastics; these items drive waste generation and greenhouse gas outputs (Solsona, 2024). For Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, moving away from standard plastic containers toward compostable alternatives prompts vital discussions around cost effectiveness and durable sustainability. Making the switch is never simple. It demands careful calibration of fiscal planning, infrastructure preparedness, and how students react. Though some research suggests long-term cost reductions via lower disposal fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions often pause due to higher upfront material prices. At Mapúa MCM, these elements compel an examination: Do the future gains justify the immediate financial and logistical strain? Consumer attitudes matter just as much. Data shows that while green materials encourage environmental seriousness (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), overall success hinges on student knowledge and willingness to participate. This creates a friction point. Institutional goals can clash with consumer habits, as the gap between stated intent and actual practice often undermines change (Solsona, 2024). This investigation thus centers on a cost-benefit analysis for the Mapúa MCM canteen's packaging swap, zeroing in on finance, ecology, and behavior. As student-researchers, we see this as timely. It highlights how academic centers can lead sustainability efforts while confronting real-world barriers in cost and execution.

International findings suggest that replacing plastic with compostable items in university food services brings both ecological and fiscal benefits. Middlebury Institute research, for example, demonstrated that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can yield positive Net Present Values (NPVs) for institutions, positioning it as an economically sound long-term choice (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, Canadian data implies that reusable containers—if cycled enough times—outperform single-use compostables environmentally and financially; usage frequency clearly shapes sustainability assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024). Bioplastics also support greener economics and UN Sustainable Development Goals, though hurdles persist regarding upfront cost, practical use, and necessary facility upgrades (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the shift shows promise but needs careful cost assessment. Yao et al. (2024) reported biodegradable materials decomposing in under a month, drastically cutting plastic pollution. Innovations like StrawPlast, which blend straw fibers with bioplastics, offer routes toward a circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Production costs make biodegradable packaging pricier than plastic, though savings can accrue later from reduced waste management burdens and adherence to green policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally, Zamboanga City adoption cut single-use plastic use, but durability, usability, and consumer buy-in remain hurdles (Mohammad, 2024). Feedback confirms general support for eco-friendly items, yet practical worries about cost and function serve as major obstacles. These observations confirm that for places like the Mapúa MCM canteen, the shift requires balancing environmental aspirations against fiscal realities and student habits. We recognize these constraints. Analyzing long-term gains versus short-term problems is crucial to judging feasibility on campus.

Guiding the plastic-to-compostable move at Mapua MCM benefits from two guiding theoretical structures: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA offers a systematic means to weigh the expense of compostable items against returns—reduced waste bills, ecological advantages, and a better institutional image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this framework lets us judge if the switch generates positive net value long-term, even with higher initial material expenses. Simultaneously, Ajzen’s TPB (1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) posits that behavior intention stems from attitudes, social norms, and perceived control (p. 03). TPB explains how students’ views on compostable items, perceived peer expectations, and how easy they think the change is influence their support. Say the switch makes economic sense. Consumer pushback—due to perceived hassle or apathy—can still sink it. These theories combine well. They build a complete way of looking at things, integrating economic modeling with behavioral understanding. This combination means the research addresses not just if the packaging is affordable, but also the social mechanics that decide if the change sticks in the Mapua MCM community.

Sustainable packaging gets attention lately. Still, gaps persist. Philippine educational settings are especially under-researched. Many models come from abroad, failing to map onto local infrastructure limits or the specific behaviors here. For instance, is there limited knowledge about campus readiness? Do they even have systems for waste sorting or composting? Canteen staff concerns—cost, durability, supply—also get overlooked often. Reusables present an option too. Yet, comparative studies pitting reusables against compostables in campus settings remain rare. We also need to check how local rules either help or block these shifts.

This study seeks to map the feasibility of swapping plastic for compostable packaging. We assess long-term vendor viability. We also evaluate the attitudes, social pressures, and perceived control felt by students and faculty adopting the new practice at Mapúa MCM. We want to understand implementation. Not just social acceptance. Also, the economic impact on the vendors. The ultimate goal? A clear view guaranteeing the shift is financially sound and fully backed by the entire campus body. This helps regulate disposable products.
