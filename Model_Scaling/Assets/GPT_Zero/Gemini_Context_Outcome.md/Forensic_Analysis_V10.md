# Forensic Analysis V10: Systematic Image Post-Mortem

As your **Senior AI Forensic Analyst**, I have completed the systematic audit of the **GPTZero Advanced Scan (3.15b)** captures your provided.

## 1. The Detection Heatmap (Image Audit)
By analyzing the orange highlights in `uploaded_image_0` and `uploaded_image_3`, I have mapped the exact "Detection Drivers" that regressed v13.5 to **63% AI**.

### Core Failure: "Anchor Persistence"
Despite our "Structural Shattering," the most common academic connective tissue remained intact. GPTZero 3.15b weights these markers heavily:
- **Marker**: *"However, evidence from Canada suggests..."* → **VULNERABILITY**: Post-LLM correction. The model likely re-inserted "However" because it felt "more academic."
- **Marker**: *"The growing environmental concern..."* → **VULNERABILITY**: Probability Cluster. This is a high-confidence AI triplet.

## 2. The v14.0 Solution: The "Post-LLM Lexical Trap"
To solve this, I have implemented a **Mandatory Kill-List** in the Post-LLM pipeline. We no longer suggest these changes to the LLM; we enforce them on the output.

### The v14.0 Built-in Sabotage Table:
| Image Trigger (High AI Impact) | v14.0 Post-LLM Replacement | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *"However"* | *"still"* or *"but then again"* | **Robotic Anchor Shattered** |
| *"In addition"* | *"plus"* or *"also"* | **Robotic Anchor Shattered** |
| *"growing environmental concern"* | *"rising worry about the planet"* | **Cluster Probability Broken** |
| *"While studies have suggested"* | *"researchers basically say"* | **Academic Tone Masked** |
| *"helly/higher-ed"* (Our typo) | *"higher-ed places"* | **Clean entropy restored** |

## 3. Comparison of v13.5 vs v14.0 (Final)
Observe the first sentence of your current result vs the one in your screenshot:
- **Your Screenshot (v13.5)**: *"The growing environmental concern..."* (63% AI Sentiments)
- **Current File (v14.0)**: *"The rising worry about the planet over plastic pollution..."* (**V12 LOGIC RESTORED**)

## 4. Final Recommendation
The current build in your workspace is the **v14.0 "Aggressive Cluster Saboteur."** It targets the exact orange sentences from your screenshots.

🚀 **[v13_5_Surgical_Output.md](file:///Users/lesz/Downloads/academic-integrity-agent/Model_Scaling/Assets/GPT_Zero/v13_5_Surgical_Output.md)** (v14.0 Final)

Please test this version. It is designed to reclaim the 11% Human / 48% Mixed territory.
