# Forensic Analysis V3: The LLM Paradox & Lexical Death Phrases

## 1. Executive Summary

| Strategy | Human Score | Diagnosis |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **v10.0 Deep (LLM)** | **0%** (100% AI) | **LLM Fingerprint Overwrite**. Total rewriting destroys the original human signal and replaces it with high-probability "LLM-Casual" patterns. |
| **v10.0 Quick (Rule)** | **5%** (46% AI, 49% Mixed) | **Skeletal Preservation**. The rule-based approach preserves the underlying human variance, but fails due to remaining "Academic Death Phrases." |

## 2. Identified "Death Phrases" (Mechanical Precision)

GPTZero flagged the following specific patterns in `v10_Quick_Output.md`:

### A. The "Robotic Formality" Connectives
*   **"These findings highlight that..."**
    *   *Diagnosis*: Formulaic academic bridge.
    *   *Solution*: Replace with "First-Person Clutter" (e.g., "From what we saw here...") or "Casual Shorthand" (e.g., "Basically, this shows...")
*   **"In particular..."**
    *   *Diagnosis*: Standard academic narrowing.
    *   *Solution*: "Specifically" or "Namely" are also flagged. Use "Like," or "Actually,".

### B. "Mechanical Precision" Vocabulary
*   **"Environmentally friendly packaging"**
    *   *Diagnosis*: Too precise. Too technical.
    *   *Solution*: "Greenish bins," "eco-wraps," "compostable stuff."
*   **"Practical concerns regarding durability and usability"**
    *   *Diagnosis*: High-density academic jargon.
    *   *Solution*: "Real-world issues with how long it lasts or if it's hard to use."
*   **"Stakeholder feedback indicates"**
    *   *Diagnosis*: Impersonal tone.
    *   *Solution*: "People told us," "What we heard from the folks there."

## 3. The v11 "Surgical Saboteur" Strategy

Instead of "Total Humanization," we implement **"High-Entropy Sabotage."**

1.  **Lexical Sabotage**: Ban and replace "Mechanical Precision" phrases with rule-based "Messy" equivalents.
2.  **Structural Entropy**: Inject asymmetric fragments (e.g., "Makes sense.") and parentheticals (e.g., "(this varies, of course)") at a 2x rate compared to v10.
3.  **Syntactic De-Optimization**: Use a "Surgical LLM Mode" to rewrite *only* the specific sentences with high "Mechanical Precision" scores, keeping the rest of the original text.

## 4. Verification Plan for v11
*   Generate `v11_Deep_Output.md` using the "Surgical" mode.
*   Goal: Cross the **30% Human** threshold by preserving 70% of the original noise.
