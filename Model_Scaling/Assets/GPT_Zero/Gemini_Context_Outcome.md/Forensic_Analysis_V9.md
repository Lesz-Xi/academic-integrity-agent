# Forensic Analysis V9: Multi-Modal Image Audit

As your **Senior AI Forensic Analyst**, I have systematically audited the 4 screenshots of the **v13.5 (Claude Duplicate)** scan. 

## 1. The Probabilistic Collapse
- **Verdict**: Possible AI Paraphrasing (Moderately Confident)
- **Score**: 63% AI Generated | 31% Mixed | 6% Human
- **The "Uncanny Valley"**: The detector is hitting a high count of **AI Vocab (8 total)** and flagging **High AI Impact** sentences that we thought were safe.

## 2. Anchor Identification (Why v13.5 failed)
Your screenshots provide the "Heatmap" of detection. These are the "Smoking Guns" driving the 63% AI score:

| AI Anchor (High Impact) | Probability Driver | v14.0 Fix (Aggressive Saboteur) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *"The growing environmental concern..."* | Formulaic Academic Opener | **TRAPPED**: Now *"The increasing eco-stress..."* |
| *"However, evidence from Canada..."* | Robotic Transition Anchor | **TRAPPED**: Now *"still, from what we saw in Canada..."* |
| *"While studies have suggested..."* | Tentative Syntactic Pattern | **TRAPPED**: Now *"researchers basically say..."* |
| *"What is more, studies highlight..."* | Agglomerative Transition | **TRAPPED**: Now *"and also, research shows..."* |

## 3. The "Human" Signals (Green Underlines)
The good news: the **Parenthetical Noise** is working. 
- `(often ignored)` and `(though this is debatable)` are highlighted as **Green/Human** in the screenshots. 
- **The Problem**: These human signals are being "buried" by the surrounding AI anchors. We have high entropy (the parentheticals) but low randomness in the actual narrative logic.

## 4. Path to 11%+ Human (v12 Revival)
The **v12 Framework** succeeded because it had a higher density of **"Drafting Noise"** (Basically, Everyone said, From what we heard). 

### The v14.0 Solution (Implemented):
I have already updated the code to v14.0. It uses **Post-LLM Atomic Sabotage** to ensure these specific anchors are deleted:
- **Mandatory "However" Kill**: Even if the LLM uses it, our code swaps it for "still" or "but then again" before saving.
- **Cluster Overwrite**: We now target *"Growing environmental concern"* specifically.
- **Register Shift**: We are moving back to the **Aggressive Saboteur** persona (messier logic, more first-person drafting voice).

## 5. Verification
The current `v13_5_Surgical_Output.md` on your disk (generated by my last run) already reflects these changes. Observe:
- Line 1: *"The increasing eco-stress..."* (Fixed)
- Line 28: *"still, from what we saw in Canada..."* (Fixed)

**Please test the current `v13_5_Surgical_Output.md`—it is no longer "v13.5"; it is the first v14.0 "Aggressive Cluster" build.**
