Environmental worry about plastic waste—it’s really piling up. This pressure forces institutions to look hard at packaging alternatives that aren’t so damaging. Think about our own university canteens, specifically Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao. We're facing big demands to ditch single-use stuff, which basically fuels waste and harms the climate (Solsona, 2024). Why is this transition to compostable packaging so complicated? Look, it’s about balancing the checkbook, making sure our infrastructure can handle it, and seeing if students even care enough to participate. I think people often assume compostable stuff saves money long-term, and some research backs that up through lower disposal fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, the upfront material cost makes many places hesitant. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, we have to check if those future rewards actually beat the immediate financial punch. And what about the users? Consumer views matter. Sustainable materials—things like bioplastics—do promote responsibility (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). But the whole effort fails if students don't pay attention. This is the challenge: getting what the institution wants to happen to actually match what students are willing to do (Solsona, 2024). Our goal here is a cost-benefit dive—looking at the money, the environment, and student behavior for this shift. As student-researchers, we feel this study is essential—we need to show how schools can lead by adopting better practices while acknowledging real barriers like cost. It’s messy work.

Internationally, studies actually show environmental plus economic gains from switching university food service ware to compostables. The Middlebury Institute found positive Net Present Values (NPVs) for compostable service ware, making it a sound long-term choice (Kaur & Acid, 2020). But wait. Evidence from Canada throws a curveball: reusable packaging, if you actually use it many times, might be better for both cost and the planet—frequency matters in sustainability assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024). Plus, bioplastics and renewable resources align with UN goals, supporting better economic practices. Still, usability, affordability, and required infrastructure are hurdles (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, we see promise, but we need local cost evaluations. Yao et al. (2024) showed biodegradable stuff breaks down fast, slashing plastic pollution. Innovations like StrawPlast, combining fibers with bioplastics, help push that circular economy idea (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). However, these biodegradable materials often cost more than regular plastic upfront because of production and tech needs, though waste management savings might balance that later (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally in Zamboanga City, plastic alternative adoption cut consumption, yet durability and user acceptance remain big problems (Mohammad, 2024). Stakeholders support green packaging—but they worry about cost and practicality. This tells us that for our canteen, we must balance green goals against the money and how students actually act. We recognize these constraints, but checking short-term pain against long-term gain is key to seeing if this works here. What do we think?

Guiding the plastic-to-compostable shift at Mapua MCM requires two main theoretical structures: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA lets us do a direct look at what compostable packaging costs versus the gains—less waste fees, environmental wins, and a better school reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For Mapúa MCM, this lets us see if the switch creates net value over time, even with higher material prices. Then there’s TPB, which Ajzen (1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) outlined. TPB basically says an action's success depends on attitudes, social pressure, and how easy people think the change is (p. 03). So, even if compostable packaging makes economic sense, student resistance due to inconvenience or just not caring about the environment could kill the program. These theories combined give us a complete structure. We don't just look at the money; we look at the social dynamics that determine if this transition actually sticks. This matters.

Sustainable packaging is popular now, but research has real gaps, especially in Philippine schools. Many models come from international settings that don't match our local economics, limited infrastructure, or how Filipino students behave. For instance, do campuses actually have the systems—like waste sorting and composting—to handle compostables? I think we overlook this a lot. Also, while we talk about TPB, few studies check how local students and faculty truly react to these green packaging pushes. Canteen vendors often get ignored, too; they worry about supply, durability, and cost. Reusable packaging often comes up as an alternative, but practical checks comparing it to compostables on campus are rare. We also need to check how school rules help or hurt these shifts.

This study tries to pin down if switching from plastic to compostable packaging is viable for vendors long-term, while also gauging student and professor attitudes—their social pressures, their perceived control—about adopting this new habit at the Mapúa MCM canteen. I want to understand the best way to roll this out, not just socially, but financially for the vendors, too. The goal? To make sure this shift is affordable and supported by everyone on campus, contributing to regulating throwaway products. A solid plan.
