Environmental anxiety about plastic waste has pushed organizations toward greener packaging ideas. University cafeterias, especially, feel the heat to drop single-use plastics, which pump out huge amounts of trash and emissions (Solsona, 2024). At Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, switching from standard plastic containers to fully compostable ones brings up major questions on cost and real-world sustainability. This change isn't simple. It means balancing budgets, checking if the local infrastructure can cope, and winning over students. Some research suggests compostable material saves money long-term by cutting disposal fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, institutions might pause because the upfront material cost is higher. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, these trade-offs demand an assessment: do the future gains outweigh immediate financial and operational hurdles? Student attitudes matter, too. Sustainable materials like biodegradables encourage responsibility (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). But success hinges on student buy-in and awareness. Gaps between what people intend to do and what they actually practice can sink these initiatives (Solsona, 2024). This research therefore analyzes the cost-benefit of swapping plastic for compostable options in the Mapúa MCM canteen, focusing on money, the environment, and behavior. As student-researchers, we see this work as timely. It shows how colleges can lead sustainable change while facing real budget and implementation restraints.

Global studies show that university food services gain both ecological and financial upsides when moving away from plastic to compostable containers. Middlebury Institute research, for instance, indicated that compostable food service ware (CSFW) yields positive Net Present Values (NPVs) for the institution, meaning it pays off over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, Canadian data suggests reusable containers—used many times—might be cheaper and better for the environment than even single-use compostable items, so how often something is reused really shifts the sustainability math (Snyder & Park, 2024). On top of that, research points out that bioplastics support economic goals and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, though affordability, practical use, and local facilities remain obstacles (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, adopting compostable packaging shows promise, yet cost and setup need intense scrutiny. Yao et al. (2024) discovered that these biodegradable substitutes break down quickly—in under a month—slashing plastic pollution. Innovations, like StrawPlast combining straw fibers with bioplastics, offer circular economy chances (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). But studies stress that biodegradable materials usually cost more than plastic upfront, due to production and needed tech upgrades; long-term relief may come from reduced waste fees and policy alignment (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Locally, Zamboanga City reports that ditching plastic alternatives cut consumption, but recyclability, true biodegradability, and user acceptance remain hard parts (Mohammad, 2024). Feedback suggests people support green packaging—in theory. Practical issues like durability, ease of use, and price continue to block progress. These findings stress that for a place like the Mapúa MCM canteen, switching requires balancing green goals against money and how students act. We recognize these pressures. Still, analyzing short-term pain against long-term gain is key to seeing if this shift works here.

Guiding the plastic-to-compostable conversion at Mapua MCM needs two key frameworks: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA offers a structured way to weigh the expense of compostable containers against their advantages—like lower waste bills, cleaner environment, and better institutional image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this means judging if the shift creates positive net value long-term, even with higher material prices upfront. At the same time, TPB, first proposed by Ajzen (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024), posits that behavior intention stems from attitudes, social expectations, and what a person feels they can control (p. 03). TPB explains how students' feelings about compostables, what their peers expect, and how easy the change seems will shape their willingness to support the shift. For example, even if compostable containers save money, consumers might resist them if they seem inconvenient or if they simply don't care much about the environment. Using both theories together builds a complete picture. This way, the investigation addresses not just the economic chance of adopting compostable options, but also the social currents determining if the move sticks in the Mapua MCM community.

Sustainable packaging gets a lot of attention now. Still, gaps exist in research, especially concerning Philippine schools. A lot of existing work relies on international examples that might not match local costs, infrastructure limits, or student mindsets at places like Mapúa MCM. For example, we don't have much data on whether campuses have the systems in place—waste sorting, composting centers—to actually handle compostable waste. Also, while behavioral ideas like TPB get wide application, few studies check how Filipino students and staff truly feel about these packaging changes. Canteen vendors often get sidelined, even though they manage implementation and worry about cost, sturdiness, and supply. Reusable packaging gets discussed as a choice, yet real studies comparing it against compostable options on campus are rare. We also need to check how campus rules or local laws help or hurt these transitions.

This research aims to check if switching from plastic to compostable packaging is viable long-term for vendors, and to measure the attitudes, social pressures felt, and perceived control students and faculty have over adopting the greener approach at the Mapúa MCM canteen. We seek to map out how to put this change in place effectively, looking past just social acceptance to examine money matters for the vendors, too. The final target is a clear picture that guarantees the shift is financially sound and truly backed by the entire campus population, which helps regulate single-use products.
