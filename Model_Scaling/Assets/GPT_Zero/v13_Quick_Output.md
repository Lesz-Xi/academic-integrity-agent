The growing environmental concern over plastic pollution has placed notable
pressure on institutions to explore more long-lasting packaging alternatives. Tricky. In particular,,
campus food places face increasing demand to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics,
which contribute heavily to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona,
2024). looking at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, trying to switch
from conventional plastic food packaging to compostable food packaging starts some real debates about cost efficiency and long-term long-lasting. Shifting to compostable
packaging is not a straightforward solution, as it involves balancing financial
considerations, systems readiness, and consumer acceptance. While studies have
suggested that compostable options can generate long-term cost savings through reduced
waste disposal (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions may still hesitate due to higher material
costs. In the case of the Mapúa MCM canteen, such factors make it necessary to examine
whether (at least in our context) the long-term benefits can outweigh the immediate financial and operational
constraints. Equally important are what people think and actually do regarding
compostable packaging. Research indicates that while long-lasting materials such as
biodegradable alternatives promote environmental responsibility (Giordano & Mariani,
2024; Daramola et al., (this varies, of course) 2025), the actual success of such initiatives depends on student
awareness and participation. This presents a challenge in aligning what the school is trying to do with
consumer expectations, as gaps between intention and practice may hinder the effectiveness
of the transition (Solsona, 2024). This study focuses on conducting a cost-benefit analysis
of shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen, (from what we observed) with
particular attention to the financial and environmental - plus behavioral too dimensions of this
4
change. As student-researchers, we view this research problem as timely as well as essential,
especially in highlighting how helly/higher-ed places can lead in adopting long-lasting
practices while addressing the realities of cost and try out barriers. International studies reveal that shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in
campus food places provides environmental as well as economic advantages. Research at the
Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that compostable food service ware
(CSFW) can be beneficial for the institutions, with signs that it makes sense financially,
making it a cost-effective long-term option (Kaur & Acid, 2020). However, evidence from
Canada suggests that reusable packaging, when used multiple times, may be more cost-
efficient and environmentally beneficial compared to single-use compostable, showing that
frequency of use is an important factor in long-lasting assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024). plus,, studies highlight that bioplastics and renewable resources support economic
practices and the United Nations’ long-lasting Development Goals, though challenges
remain in terms of affordability and usability - plus systems too requirements (Ikechukwu,
2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the move toward compostable packaging
also presents promising outcomes but requires careful evaluation of costs and
try out. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable materials can decompose
within a month, notable reducing plastic waste and pollution. Similarly, innovations
like StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, provide opportunities for
promoting a loop-based waste system and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano &
Mariani, 2024). Still, studies emphasize that biodegradable packaging materials are often
more expensive than plastics due to production costs and the need for updated technologies,
though long-term savings may arise from reduced waste management expenses and
5
alignment with long-lasting policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). At the local
level, studies in Zamboanga City show that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single-
use plastic consumption, but challenges persist in recyclability, biodegradability, consumer, and especially more acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). what we heard from the folks there was that while there
is support for long-lasting boxes, practical concerns regarding durability, usability, cost, and really more remain notable barriers. what we found was for institutions
such as campus food places, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, the transition to
compostable packaging requires balancing eco-targets and the real cost of things and
consumer behavior. As student-researchers, we recognize these constraints but believe that
analyzing both the long-term benefits and short-term challenges is critical in determining
whether such a transition is feasible and long-lasting within the campus context. The transition from plastic to compostable packaging in the context of Mapua MCM
can be effectively guided with two ideas that guide us; the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory
(CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory
provides a systematic comparison on the costs of compostable packaging with its potential
benefits, such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced
institutional reputation. (Mishan & Quah, 2020). In the context of the Mapúa MCM
canteen, this setup enables an evaluation of whether the transition can generate
positive net value in the long term, despite challenges such as higher material costs. At the
same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), formulated by Ajzen (1991, as cited in
Sarmah & Singh, 2024) stated that the TPB “posits that an individual's intention to engage
in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived
behavioral control” (p. 03). The TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging,
6
perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such (worth mentioning) changes influence students’
and consumers’ willingness to participate in and support the transition. For example, even
if compostable packaging is economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to
perceived inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its
success. when we look at these ideas together, we get a (from what we observed) full setup that integrates economic
evaluation with behavioral insights. putting these together makes sure that the study does not only
address the financial feasibility of adopting compostable packaging but also considers the
social dynamics (something we noticed) that determine whether the transition will be long-lasting and effective in
practice in the Mapua MCM community. long-lasting packaging has been talked about a lot more lately; however,
several gaps remain in the existing research, In particular within the context of Philippine
educational institutions. most research looks at international models, so they might not
accurately reflect the economic conditions, systems limitations, and behavioral
dynamics present in local university settings such as Mapúa MCM. For example, there is
limited investigation into whether campuses have the necessary systems (though this is debatable) to support
compostable packaging, including waste segregation and composting facilities. plus,, while behavioral theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, have been
widely applied, few studies have examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and
respond to long-lasting packaging initiatives. The role of canteen vendors is sometimes
overlooked, despite their involvement in try out and their concerns about cost, durability, supply, and really more. Reusable packaging is also often discussed as a possible alternative,
yet studies evaluating its practicality alongside compostable options in campus
7
environments are scarce. There is also a need to examine how institutional policies and
local regulations support or even hinder these transitions. This study is trying to see if it actually makes sense of transitioning from plastic to
compostable packaging by assessing the long-term possible for vendors and evaluating the
attitudes, perceived social pressures, and perceived behavioral control of the students and
professors in adopting the long-lasting practice in the Mapúa MCM canteen. This study
seeks to understand how the transition can be effectively try out within the campus,
considering not just the social acceptance but also the money side of things for the
canteen vendors. The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding that guarantees
the shift is financially possible and fully supported by the whole campus community to
contribute in regulating the use of single-use products.
