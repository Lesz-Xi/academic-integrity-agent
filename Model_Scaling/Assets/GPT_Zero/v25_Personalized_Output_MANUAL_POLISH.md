     The growing environmental concern over plastic pollution has placed clear pressure on institutions to explore more sustainable packaging alternatives—this is especially true for university settings.

     In particular, university canteens face increasing demand to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics, which contribute heavily to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona, 2024).

     Within the context of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, the potential transition from conventional plastic food packaging to compostable food packaging raises crucial questions about cost efficiency and long-term sustainability, though these questions aren't always easy to answer.

     Shifting to compostable packaging is not a straightforward solution, as it involves balancing financial considerations, infrastructure readiness, and consumer acceptance.

     While studies have suggested that compostable options might generate long-term cost savings through reduced waste disposal (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions may still hesitate due to higher material costs.

     In the case of the Mapúa MCM canteen, such parts make it necessary to examine whether the long-term benefits can outweigh the immediate financial and operational constraints.

     Equally big are consumer perceptions and behaviors regarding compostable packaging.

     Research points to that while sustainable materials such as biodegradable alternatives promote environmental responsibility—as Giordano and Mariani note in their 2024 study, along with Daramola et al. (2025)—the actual success of such initiatives depends on student awareness and participation.

     This highlights a challenge in aligning institutional efforts with consumer expectations, as gaps between intention and practice may hinder the effectiveness of the transition (Solsona, 2024).

     This study focuses on conducting a cost-benefit analysis of shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen, with particular attention to the financial, environmental, and behavioral dimensions of this change.

     As student-researchers, we view this research problem as both timely and essential, especially in highlighting how academic institutions can lead in adopting sustainable practices while addressing the realities of cost and implementation barriers.

     International studies reveal that shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in university canteens provides both environmental and economic advantages. Research at the Middlebury Institute found that CSFW could be beneficial for institutions, with positive NPVs making it cost-effective long-term (Kaur & Acid, 2020)—though this depends on institutional context. However, evidence from Canada suggests that reusable packaging, when used multiple times, may be more cost-efficient and environmentally beneficial compared to single-use compostable, showing that frequency of use is an key factor in sustainability assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024).

     What's more, studies highlight that bioplastics and renewable resources support economic practices and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, though challenges remain in terms of affordability, usability, and infrastructure requirements (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

     In the Philippines, the move toward compostable packaging also brings up promising outcomes but demands careful evaluation of costs and implementation. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable materials can decompose within a month, particularly reducing plastic waste and pollution.

     Similarly, innovations like StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, provide opportunities for promoting a circular economy and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano & Mariani, 2024).

     Still, studies emphasize that biodegradable packaging materials appear to be often more expensive than plastics due to production costs and the need for updated technologies, though long-term savings may arise from reduced waste management expenses and alignment with sustainability policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024).

     At the local level, studies in Zamboanga City show that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single- use plastic consumption, but challenges persist in recyclability, biodegradability, and consumer acceptance (Mohammad, 2024).

     Stakeholder feedback shows that while there is support for environmentally friendly packaging, practical concerns regarding durability, usability, and cost remain clear barriers.

     These findings highlight that for institutions such as university canteens, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, the transition to compostable packaging calls for balancing environmental goals with financial realities and consumer behavior.

     As student-researchers, we recognize these constraints but believe that analyzing both the long-term benefits and short-term challenges is key in determining whether such a transition is feasible and sustainable within the campus context.

     The transition from plastic to compostable packaging in the context of Mapua MCM might be effectively guided with two theoretical lenses; the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).

     The Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory provides a systematic comparison on the costs of compostable packaging with its potential benefits, such as reduced. waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced institutional reputation. (Mishan & Quah, 2020). In the context of the Mapúa MCM canteen, this framework enables an evaluation of whether the transition can generate positive net value in the long term, despite challenges such as higher material costs.

     At the same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), formulated by Ajzen (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) stated that the TPB "posits that an individual's intention to engage in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control" (p. 03).

     The TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging, perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such changes influence students' and consumers' willingness to participate in and support the transition.

     For example, even if compostable packaging may be economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to perceived inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its success.

     Together, these theories provide a holistic framework that integrates economic evaluation with behavioral insights. The combination ensures that the study does not only address the financial feasibility of adopting compostable packaging but also considers the social dynamics that determine whether the transition will be sustainable and effective in practice in the Mapua MCM community.

     Sustainable packaging has received increasing attention in recent years; however, several gaps remain in the existing research, specifically within the context of Philippine educational institutions.

     Many studies are based on international models, which may not accurately reflect the economic conditions, infrastructure limitations, and behavioral dynamics show in local university settings such as Mapúa MCM.

     For example, there is limited investigation into whether campuses have the necessary systems to support compostable packaging, including waste segregation and composting facilities.

     Additionally, while behavioral theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, have been widely applied, few studies have examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and respond to sustainable packaging initiatives.

     The part of canteen vendors is sometimes overlooked, despite their involvement in implementation and their concerns about cost, durability, and supply.

     Reusable packaging is also often discussed as a viable alternative, yet studies evaluating its practicality alongside compostable options in campus environments are scarce.

     There is also a need to examine how institutional policies and local regulations either support or hinder these transitions.

     This study aims to determine the feasibility of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging by assessing the long-term viability for vendors and evaluating student and professor attitudes, perceived social pressures, and perceived behavioral control in adopting the sustainable practice at Mapúa MCM. We're trying to understand how this transition can work in practice on campus, looking at both social acceptance and the economic side for vendors.

     The goal of this study may be to provide a better understanding that guarantees the shift could be financially viable and fully supported by the whole campus community to contribute in regulating the use of single-use products.
