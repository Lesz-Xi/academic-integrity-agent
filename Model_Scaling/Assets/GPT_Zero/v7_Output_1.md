The environmental worry about plastic waste has really pushed institutions to look at greener packaging ways. Specifically, I think university canteens are under big pressure to cut down on single-use plastics, which pump out tons of trash and emissions (Solsona, 2024). At Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (MCM), swapping out the regular food containers for compostable ones forces us to ask hard questions about money and whether this works long-term. Shifting isn't easy, look. It means juggling finances, checking if the infrastructure is ready, and seeing if students will actually use it. We know some research suggests compostable stuff *can* save money over time by cutting waste fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020), but the higher sticker price might make the administration nervous. This makes us examine if MCM can actually handle the immediate cash outlay and operational hurdles for those future gains.

What about student feelings, though? Consumer acceptance is just as big a deal. The materials—like biodegradables—definitely promote environmental care, I agree (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). But the real success story depends on student awareness and participation. This creates a weird gap, right? Institutions try to move forward, but student intentions don't always match their practice, which messes up the whole push (Solsona, 2024). Our study focuses on doing a direct look at the costs versus the benefits of this switch at the MCM canteen—looking at the money, the environment, and how people behave. As student-researchers, we feel this project is essential right now. Why? Because we need to show how schools can lead on sustainability while respecting real-world budget limits.

International findings show that moving away from plastic toward compostable service ware in campus settings offers both green and economic wins. At Middlebury, they found that compostable food service ware (CSFW) could even give institutions a positive Net Present Value—a cost-effective choice down the road (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Still, the Canadian data presents a different picture. Evidence suggests that reusable packaging, used many times over, might be cheaper and better for the planet than single-use compostable options; usage frequency is key to the sustainability score (Snyder & Park, 2024). Plus, bioplastics using renewable resources support green economics and the UN's goals, though affordability, usability, and infrastructure remain hurdles (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

Out here in the Philippines, the compostable move looks good but needs local scrutiny. Yao et al. (2024) noted biodegradable materials break down fast, which cuts plastic pollution. Innovations like StrawPlast—mixing straw fibers with bioplastics—offer ways to push a circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). But studies always emphasize that these materials cost more upfront because of production and tech needs, even if waste management savings balance it out later (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Even in Zamboanga City, cutting plastic use is happening, but durability, usability, and student buy-in remain tough problems (Mohammad, 2024). These facts tell me that for a place like the MCM canteen, we have to balance the green goals with the cash flow and how students actually act. We recognize these constraints, but we need to analyze the good long-term stuff against the short-term pain to see if this switch really works on campus.

The change at Mapua MCM—plastic to compostable—can be guided by two theories I think we must use: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA lets us do a direct look at the costs of compostable packaging against the upsides, like lower waste fees, environmental benefits, and a better campus image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the MCM canteen, this lets us check if the move makes positive net value over time, even with those higher initial material costs. Then there's TPB, which Ajzen created (cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). It basically posits that a person’s intention to do something—say, use the new packaging—is driven by their attitude, what their peers think, and how easy they think the change is (p. 03). So, student attitudes, social pressure, and how easy it is to adapt—those things matter for support. Even if compostable packaging is smart financially, if students think it's inconvenient or just don't care about green stuff, the whole thing flops.

These two theories together give us a full picture. They make sure we aren't just looking at the money aspect of using compostable containers; we're also looking at the social stuff that makes or breaks if the transition sticks around for the Mapua MCM crew. Does that make sense? Yes.

We've seen a lot about sustainable packaging lately, but I think there are gaps, especially here in Philippine schools. A lot of the models come from overseas, and those numbers might not fit our local economy, our infrastructure limits, or how Filipino students actually act. For instance, do campuses even have the right trash setup for compostable waste? We don't really know. Also, while behavioral theories like TPB are popular, few studies check how local students and faculty actually react to these packaging pushes. The canteen vendors—their role in all this is often forgotten, even though they worry about cost and durability. Reusable packaging gets talked about a lot as an option, but we haven't seen many direct checks comparing it side-by-side with compostable options on campus. We also need to see how school rules help or hurt these shifts.

The main goal here? To figure out if switching from plastic to compostable is viable for the vendors long-term, and to check the attitudes, social pressure, and control students and professors feel about adopting this new green practice at Mapúa MCM. I want to understand the best way to roll this out—not just if people will accept it socially, but what it means financially for the vendors. Ultimately, we aim to give a better understanding that guarantees the shift is financially sound and that the whole campus community actually supports it, helping regulate the use of disposable stuff. A huge goal.
