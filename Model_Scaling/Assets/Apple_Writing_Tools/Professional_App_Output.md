Plastic pollution has become a major concern, and schools are feeling pressure to find better packaging alternatives. School cafeterias are dealing with increased demand to eliminate single-use plastics because of their impact on waste production and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona, 2024). At Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, we're considering a switch from conventional plastic food packaging to compostable materials, but the process is more complex than it appears.

The transition to compostable packaging involves more than environmental considerations. Financial implications, operational capacity, and student engagement all play crucial roles. Some research indicates that compostable options can reduce long-term costs through lower waste disposal expenses (Kaur & Acid, 2020), but the initial material costs are higher. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, we need to determine whether the long-term advantages justify the immediate challenges and expenses.

Student attitudes present another challenge. Research demonstrates that sustainable materials like biodegradable alternatives create positive feelings about environmental responsibility (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), but these programs succeed only when students understand and participate in them. A significant gap often exists between stated intentions and actual behavior, which could undermine the entire transition (Solsona, 2024).

Our study conducts a cost-benefit analysis of switching from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen. We're examining financial factors, environmental impact, behavioral patterns, and other relevant considerations. As student-researchers, we believe this work is particularly important for demonstrating how educational institutions can lead sustainable practices while addressing real financial constraints and implementation challenges.

International studies suggest that the shift from plastic to compostable packaging in school cafeterias offers both environmental and economic advantages. Research at the Middlebury Institute found that compostable food service items can benefit institutions with strong long-term returns, making them cost-effective over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Canadian research suggests that reusable packaging might be more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly compared to single-use compostable options when used multiple times - frequency of use becomes critical for sustainability assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024).

Studies also demonstrate that bioplastics and renewable resources support sustainable practices and UN Sustainable Development Goals, though challenges remain with affordability, usability, and infrastructure requirements (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippines, the move toward compostable packaging appears promising but requires careful cost and implementation evaluation. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable materials can decompose within a month, significantly reducing plastic waste and pollution. Innovations like StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, create opportunities for promoting a circular economy and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Studies emphasize that biodegradable packaging materials often cost more than plastics due to production expenses and new technology requirements, though long-term savings may result from reduced waste management costs and alignment with sustainable policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024).

Local studies in Zamboanga City show that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single-use plastic consumption, but challenges persist in recyclability, biodegradability, and consumer acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). Researchers found that while support exists for green packaging solutions, practical concerns about durability, usability, and cost remain significant barriers. For institutions like school cafeterias, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, transitioning to compostable packaging requires balancing environmental goals with budget constraints and consumer behavior. As student-researchers, we recognize these limitations but believe that analyzing both long-term benefits and short-term challenges is essential for determining whether such a transition is feasible and sustainable within our campus context.

The transition from plastic to compostable packaging at Mapúa MCM can be guided by two theoretical frameworks: Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory provides a systematic comparison of compostable packaging costs with potential benefits, such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced institutional reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this framework enables evaluation of whether the transition can generate positive net value long-term, despite challenges like higher material costs.

The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), developed by Ajzen (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024), states that TPB "posits that an individual's intention to engage in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control" (p. 03). TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging, perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such changes influence students' and consumers' willingness to participate in and support the transition. Even if compostable packaging is economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to perceived inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its success.

These theories provide a framework that integrates economic evaluation with behavioral insights. This combination ensures that the study addresses not only the financial feasibility of adopting compostable packaging but also considers the social dynamics that determine whether the transition will be sustainable and effective in practice within the Mapúa MCM community.

Sustainable packaging has received increasing attention recently, but gaps remain in existing research, particularly within Philippine educational institutions. Many studies are based on international models, which may not accurately reflect the economic conditions, infrastructure limitations, and behavioral dynamics present in local university settings like Mapúa MCM. Limited investigation exists into whether campuses have necessary systems to support compostable packaging, including waste segregation and composting facilities.

While behavioral theories like the Theory of Planned Behavior have been widely applied, few studies have examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and respond to sustainable packaging initiatives. The role of canteen vendors is often overlooked, despite their involvement in implementation and their concerns about cost, durability, supply, and other factors. Reusable packaging is frequently discussed as a viable alternative, yet studies evaluating its practicality alongside compostable options in campus environments are scarce. There's also a need to examine how institutional policies and local regulations either support or hinder these transitions.

This study aims to determine the feasibility of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging by assessing the long-term viability for vendors and evaluating the attitudes, perceived social pressures, and perceived behavioral control of students and faculty in adopting sustainable practices in the Mapúa MCM canteen. We want to understand how the transition can be effectively implemented within the campus, considering not just social acceptance but also the financial side for canteen vendors. Our goal is to provide insights that ensure the shift is financially viable and fully supported by the entire campus community to contribute to regulating single-use product usage.
