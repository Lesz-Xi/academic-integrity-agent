The escalating environmental concern regarding plastic pollution has imposed substantial pressure on institutional entities to investigate more durable packaging alternatives. Educational food service facilities encounter mounting demands to diminish their dependence on single-use plastics, which contribute significantly to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona, 2024). Within the operational context of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, the potential transition from conventional plastic food packaging to compostable food packaging raises substantial questions about cost efficiency and long-term durability. The shift to compostable packaging does not constitute a straightforward solution, as it involves balancing financial considerations, infrastructure readiness, and consumer acceptance. While studies have indicated that compostable options can generate long-term cost savings through reduced waste disposal expenses (Kaur & Acid, 2020), institutions may demonstrate hesitation due to elevated material costs. In the case of the Mapúa MCM canteen, such factors necessitate examination of whether the long-term benefits can outweigh the immediate financial and operational constraints. Equally significant are student perceptions and behaviors regarding compostable packaging. Research indicates that while sustainable materials such as biodegradable alternatives promote environmental responsibility (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), the actual success of such initiatives depends on student awareness and participation levels. This creates challenges in aligning campus-wide initiatives with consumer expectations, as gaps between intention and practice may hinder the effectiveness of the transition (Solsona, 2024). This study focuses on conducting a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen, with particular attention to the financial, environmental, behavioral, and operational dimensions of this transition. As student-researchers, we view this research problem as both timely and essential, particularly in highlighting how educational institutions can demonstrate leadership in adopting sustainable practices while addressing the realities of cost and implementation barriers.

International studies reveal that shifting from plastic to compostable packaging in educational food service facilities provides both environmental and economic advantages. Research conducted at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies determined that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can be beneficial for institutions, with favorable long-term returns and net present value, making it a cost-effective long-term option (Kaur & Acid, 2020). However, evidence from Canadian research suggests that reusable packaging, when utilized multiple times, may be more cost-efficient and environmentally beneficial compared to single-use compostable alternatives, demonstrating that frequency of use constitutes an important factor in sustainability assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024). Additionally, studies highlight that bioplastics and renewable resources support sustainable practices and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, though challenges remain in terms of affordability and infrastructure requirements (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). In the Philippines, the movement toward compostable packaging presents promising outcomes but requires careful evaluation of costs and implementation strategies. Yao et al. (2024) determined that biodegradable materials can decompose within a month, substantially reducing plastic waste and environmental pollution. Similarly, innovations such as StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, provide opportunities for promoting a circular economy and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Nevertheless, studies emphasize that biodegradable packaging materials are often more expensive than conventional plastics due to production costs and the need for advanced technologies, though long-term savings may arise from reduced waste management expenses and alignment with sustainable policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). At the local level, studies in Zamboanga City demonstrate that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single-use plastic consumption, but challenges persist in recyclability, biodegradability, and consumer acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). Research indicates that while there exists support for environmentally friendly packaging alternatives, practical concerns regarding durability, usability, and cost remain substantial barriers. For institutions such as educational food service facilities, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, the transition to compostable packaging requires balancing environmental objectives with financial constraints and consumer behavior patterns. As student-researchers, we recognize these constraints but believe that analyzing both the long-term benefits and short-term challenges is essential in determining whether such a transition is feasible and sustainable within the campus context.

The transition from plastic to compostable packaging in the context of Mapúa MCM can be effectively guided through two theoretical frameworks: the Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory provides a systematic framework for comparing the costs of compostable packaging with its potential benefits, such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced institutional reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). In the context of the Mapúa MCM canteen, this framework enables an evaluation of whether the transition can generate positive net value in the long term, despite challenges such as elevated material costs. Simultaneously, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), formulated by Ajzen (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024) states that the TPB "posits that an individual's intention to engage in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control" (p. 03). The TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging, perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such changes influence students' and consumers' willingness to participate in and support the transition. For instance, even if compostable packaging is economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to perceived inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its success. Together, these theories provide a comprehensive framework that integrates economic evaluation with behavioral insights. This combination ensures that the study addresses not only the financial feasibility of adopting compostable packaging but also considers the social dynamics that determine whether the transition will be sustainable and effective in practice within the Mapúa MCM community.

Sustainable packaging has received increasing attention in recent years; however, several gaps remain in the existing research, particularly within the context of Philippine educational institutions. Many studies are based on international models, which may not accurately reflect the economic conditions, infrastructure limitations, and behavioral dynamics present in local university settings such as Mapúa MCM. For example, there exists limited investigation into whether campuses possess the necessary systems to support compostable packaging, including waste segregation and composting facilities. Additionally, while behavioral theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, have been widely applied, few studies have examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and respond to sustainable packaging initiatives. The role of canteen vendors is often overlooked, despite their involvement in implementation and their concerns about cost, durability, and supply chain management. Reusable packaging is also frequently discussed as a viable alternative, yet studies evaluating its practicality alongside compostable options in campus environments are limited. There exists also a need to examine how institutional policies and local regulations either support or hinder these transitions. This study aims to determine the feasibility of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging by assessing the long-term viability for vendors and evaluating the attitudes, perceived social pressures, and perceived behavioral control of students and professors in adopting sustainable practices in the Mapúa MCM canteen. This study seeks to understand how the transition can be effectively implemented within the campus, considering not only social acceptance but also the financial implications for canteen vendors. The objective of this study is to provide comprehensive insights that ensure the shift is financially viable and fully supported by the entire campus community to contribute to regulating the use of single-use products.
