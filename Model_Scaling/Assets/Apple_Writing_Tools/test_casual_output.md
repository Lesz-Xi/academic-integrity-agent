So basically, everyone's freaking out about plastic pollution these days, and schools are feeling the pressure to find better packaging options. I mean, school cafeterias are getting hit with all this demand to stop using single-use plastics because they're terrible for waste and greenhouse gases (Solsona, 2024). At Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, we're looking at switching from regular plastic food packaging to compostable stuff, but honestly? It's way more complicated than it sounds.

The thing is, switching to compostable packaging isn't just about being eco-friendly. You've got to think about money, whether the school can actually handle it, and if students will even care. Some studies say compostable options can save money in the long run because you spend less on waste disposal (Kaur & Acid, 2020), but the materials cost more upfront. So for the Mapúa MCM canteen, we really need to figure out if the long-term benefits are worth the immediate headaches and costs.

But here's another issue - what do students actually think about this? Research shows that while sustainable materials like biodegradable alternatives make people feel good about being environmentally responsible (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), these initiatives only work if students actually know about them and participate. There's often this gap between what people say they'll do and what they actually do, which could totally mess up the whole transition (Solsona, 2024).

Our study is basically doing a cost-benefit analysis of switching from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen. We're looking at financial stuff, environmental impact, how people behave, and other factors that matter. As student-researchers, we think this is super important right now, especially for showing how schools can lead in sustainable practices while dealing with real-world money problems and implementation barriers.

Looking at international studies, the shift from plastic to compostable packaging in school cafeterias seems to have both environmental and economic benefits. Research at the Middlebury Institute found that compostable food service ware can actually benefit institutions with good long-term returns, making it cost-effective over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). But Canadian research suggests that reusable packaging might be more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly compared to single-use compostable options when you use them multiple times - so frequency of use really matters for sustainability assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024).

Studies also show that bioplastics and renewable resources support sustainable practices and UN Sustainable Development Goals, though there are still challenges with affordability and usability, plus infrastructure requirements (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippines, moving toward compostable packaging looks promising but needs careful cost and implementation evaluation. Yao et al. (2024) found that biodegradable materials can decompose within a month, significantly reducing plastic waste and pollution. Innovations like StrawPlast, which combine straw fibers with bioplastics, create opportunities for promoting a circular economy and minimizing environmental damage (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Still, studies emphasize that biodegradable packaging materials are often more expensive than plastics due to production costs and the need for new technologies, though long-term savings may come from reduced waste management expenses and alignment with sustainable policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024).

Locally, studies in Zamboanga City show that adopting plastic alternatives has reduced single-use plastic consumption, but challenges persist in recyclability, biodegradability, and consumer acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). What researchers found was that while there's support for green packaging solutions, practical concerns about durability, usability, and cost remain significant barriers. For institutions like school cafeterias, including the Mapúa MCM canteen, transitioning to compostable packaging requires balancing environmental goals with actual budget constraints and consumer behavior. As student-researchers, we recognize these limitations but believe that analyzing both long-term benefits and short-term challenges is crucial for determining whether such a transition is feasible and sustainable within our campus context.

The transition from plastic to compostable packaging at Mapua MCM can be effectively guided by two theoretical frameworks: Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Cost-Benefit Analysis Theory provides a systematic comparison of compostable packaging costs with potential benefits, such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental gains, and enhanced institutional reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this framework enables evaluation of whether the transition can generate positive net value long-term, despite challenges like higher material costs.

Meanwhile, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), formulated by Ajzen (1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024), states that TPB "posits that an individual's intention to engage in a particular behavior is determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control" (p. 03). TPB explains that attitudes toward compostable packaging, perceived social expectations, and the ease of adopting such changes influence students' and consumers' willingness to participate in and support the transition. For example, even if compostable packaging is economically justifiable, resistance from consumers due to perceived inconvenience or indifference toward environmental issues may hinder its success.

Together, these theories provide a comprehensive framework that integrates economic evaluation with behavioral insights. This combination ensures that the study addresses not only the financial feasibility of adopting compostable packaging but also considers the social dynamics that determine whether the transition will be sustainable and effective in practice within the Mapua MCM community.

Sustainable packaging has received increasing attention recently, but several gaps remain in existing research, particularly within Philippine educational institutions. Many studies are based on international models, which may not accurately reflect the economic conditions, infrastructure limitations, and behavioral dynamics present in local university settings like Mapúa MCM. For example, there's limited investigation into whether campuses have necessary systems to support compostable packaging, including waste segregation and composting facilities.

While behavioral theories like the Theory of Planned Behavior have been widely applied, few studies have examined how Filipino students and faculty perceive and respond to sustainable packaging initiatives. The role of canteen vendors is often overlooked, despite their crucial involvement in implementation and their concerns about cost, durability, supply, and other factors. Reusable packaging is also frequently discussed as a viable alternative, yet studies evaluating its practicality alongside compostable options in campus environments are scarce. There's also a need to examine how institutional policies and local regulations either support or hinder these transitions.

This study aims to determine the feasibility of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging by assessing the long-term viability for vendors and evaluating the attitudes, perceived social pressures, and perceived behavioral control of students and faculty in adopting sustainable practices in the Mapúa MCM canteen. We want to understand how the transition can be effectively implemented within the campus, considering not just social acceptance but also the financial side for canteen vendors. Our goal is to provide insights that ensure the shift is financially viable and fully supported by the entire campus community to contribute to regulating single-use product usage.
