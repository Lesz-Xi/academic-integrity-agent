The study employs a quantitative, descriptive-survey design. Essentially, this involves gathering measurable opinions, behaviors, or perceptions from a defined group using structured tools like questionnaires or interviews, as Apuke (2021) explains. This specific framework fits perfectly because the core aim involves quantifying the attitudes, operational difficulties, and budget concerns canteen employees face when thinking about ditching plastic for compostable packaging.

Choosing a quantitative approach seems logical; the research requires numerical proof to allow for statistical evaluation, spotting patterns within employee responses (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Objectivity in data collection and assessment is preserved by focusing squarely on measurable variables: managing costs, ease of daily workflow, and perceived ecological benefits. This design also directly supports the cost-benefit assessment—a component central to the study that demands strictly numerical input (Kenton, 2021).

This descriptive survey structure aligns well with the research's foundation, Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). TPB focuses on how individual attitudes, external pressures from peers (subjective norms), and a person’s sense of personal control ultimately influence their actions and choices. Employing this framework allows researchers to capture employee views on how hard and feasible it is to switch from plastic to compostable items, especially regarding workflow disruption and budgetary outcomes.

Selecting Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM) provides location-specific relevance; the campus canteen generates a significant portion of campus waste. By obtaining input directly from canteen staff—the people handling, packing, and serving the food every day—we ensure the figures gathered truly mirror the real-world experience with feasibility issues, workload shifts, and the genuine expenses tied to moving away from conventional plastic packaging.
