The issue of plastic waste has become a significant concern, with schools being urged to address it, particularly in campus cafeterias. The use of single-use plastic in these settings contributes to the growing waste problem, impacting the environment. Mapúa MCM is exploring the possibility of replacing the usual plastic containers with compostable alternatives. However, this transition is not without its challenges.

Implementing a compostable system requires careful consideration of the budget, infrastructure, and the response from the student population. The upfront costs for the new containers can be considerably higher, posing a financial burden. Additionally, the logistics of having the appropriate bins and waste management processes in place must be addressed. The question arises: are the long-term environmental benefits worth the short-term financial and operational challenges?

Furthermore, the success of this initiative depends heavily on the students' engagement and understanding. While the idea of biodegradable materials may be appealing, the actual practice of proper disposal and maintenance can be a significant hurdle. If students do not actively participate in the composting process or lack the knowledge to do so, the effort may fall short of its intended impact.

This research endeavor is highly relevant, as educational institutions are expected to lead by example in sustainability efforts. However, the team conducting the research must balance the environmental aspirations with the practical realities of cost, logistics, and student behavior. The findings from this study will provide valuable insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing compostable alternatives in the Mapúa MCM canteen.

Examining the practices of other institutions provides some useful insights. Researchers at Middlebury have found that utilizing compostable materials can be financially viable in the long-term, yielding a positive net present value (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Conversely, Canadian schools suggest that perpetual washing and reuse of materials may be preferable to any single-use option, including compostable ones, depending on the frequency of usage (Snyder & Park, 2024). Employing plant-based materials aligns with the green economy and United Nations sustainability goals, though cost and infrastructure remain significant barriers (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippines, compostable packaging also appears promising. One study indicates that biodegradable materials degrade within a month, vastly outperforming plastic's longevity (Yao et al., 2024). Innovative mixtures of agricultural byproducts and bioplastics are being developed to support the circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). However, these materials tend to have higher upfront costs, which may be offset by reduced waste disposal fees and alignment with green government policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). In Zamboanga, the transition reduced plastic usage but sparked complaints about fragility and consumer dissatisfaction with the new materials (Mohammad, 2024). For Mapúa MCM, navigating the balance between environmental sustainability, budgetary constraints, and student acceptance poses a significant challenge.

To analyze this complex issue, the team is employing two main theoretical frameworks. The first is Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), a formal approach to comparing the expenditures on novel packaging against the savings from reduced waste disposal, as well as the intangible benefits of environmental stewardship and institutional reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). CBA should reveal whether the switch makes financial sense in the long run, despite potentially higher initial packaging costs.


The Theory of Planned Behavior, or TPB, is another prominent theory. This framework posits that individuals' intentions to perform a behavior are contingent upon their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (Ajzen, 1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). Consequently, even if the compostable option offers substantial cost savings for the school, students may not utilize it if they perceive it as inconvenient or lack sufficient motivation. By integrating cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and TPB, the feasibility of the transition can be more thoroughly evaluated.

However, significant knowledge gaps persist, particularly in the Philippine context of Mapúa MCM. The bulk of existing research originates from other countries, which may not adequately account for local budgetary constraints or waste management infrastructure. Do appropriate waste segregation facilities even exist on campus? Moreover, while TPB provides a compelling framework, limited evidence exists regarding how Filipino students and staff respond to sustainability initiatives. Notably, the perspectives of canteen vendors, who grapple with daily operational challenges, remain largely unexplored. Additionally, the comparative effectiveness of reusable versus compostable alternatives within a bustling college setting warrants further investigation. The influence of institutional and municipal regulations also requires careful consideration.

Ultimately, this study aims to assess the realistic viability of transitioning the Mapúa MCM canteen from plastic to compostable containers. The analysis must thoroughly examine the long-term feasibility for vendors, as well as delve into the attitudes, social pressures, and perceived capabilities of students and faculty. By holistically addressing both the financial and social dimensions, a more comprehensive understanding of the potential for a successful and sustainable transition can be gained.
