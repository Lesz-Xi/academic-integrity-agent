Executing this project required adherence to a standard methodology, essentially a step-by-step roadmap designed to guarantee data collection accuracy. Sticking to these established procedures was non-negotiable, given its direct link to our academic performance metrics.

We began by isolating the core research question guiding our investigation. The aim was to address a known knowledge deficit concerning how mobile wallet usage affects student spending habits. While digital money is common, the degree to which e-wallets shape actual student expenditure remains vague. Our specific interest centered on whether an excessive reliance on services like GCash pushes students toward financial strain.

To support the analysis, we conducted an extensive literature review, prioritizing accessible online materials over paywalled journals, both locally and globally. We grounded our findings in the 2003 “Financial Behavioral Theory” from Barberis and Thaler, which suggests individuals frequently bypass perfectly rational financial decision-making. Applying this framework allowed us to effectively frame the problem: the simple convenience of mobile wallets, like Maya and GCash, often enables impulsive buying, thereby undercutting student savings for tuition.

For the survey instrument, we repurposed a pre-existing questionnaire structure from a 2022 study by Shivranjani R. that focused on general online shopping behavior. We kept the convenient Likert scale format for easier grading, but we heavily adapted the content. The shopping-specific inquiries were overhauled to fit our focus, shifting to questions about the frequency of Maya and GCash usage and the students' self-reported ability to track daily expenditures. These necessary modifications accounted for roughly 30% of the final instrument, ensuring adequate originality.

The next hurdle involved the difficult recruitment of participants. We used purposive sampling, a term that sounds complex but simply means selecting people who fit specific pre-set criteria. We weren't surveying faculty or random citizens. We required active first-year students enrolled in our specific section, ENG024, at MCM, who also used e-wallets regularly. Anyone not using GCash was immediately disqualified. We needed genuine feedback, not guesswork, which unfortunately limited our final pool to 30 individuals. While small, thirty responses are certainly preferable to five for a narrowly defined study. The primary qualification was the participant’s capacity to articulate their current daily money management routines.

Fortunately, the actual data collection phase was the most straightforward part of the whole process. We deployed Google Forms, eliminating the tedious labor of transcribing paper surveys. We distributed the link during the second week of the relevant academic period. Confidentiality and anonymity were the main ethical considerations here. We presented a consent form detailing the nature of participation, then waited for responses to arrive. Protecting students’ financial privacy, especially concerning small expenditures like street food, remains critical.

Once the 30 responses trickled in, we started the data cleaning protocol. This means checking for completeness and accuracy. We manually verified every entry, discarding nonsense inputs—like someone listing a monthly allowance of “ten million dollars”—and ensuring all required slots were filled. If a participant skipped the question about budgeting for transportation, we either flagged the entire survey or marked that specific answer as missing.

The concluding step involved analysis. Given the small sample size of 30, advanced machine learning was off the table. We defaulted to quantitative descriptive analysis, relying on basic statistics like mean, median, and mode to get a quick picture of student finance habits. We targeted specific metrics: the percentage favoring GCash over Maya, and how often weekly spending cleared the 500-peso mark. This analysis helped map out typical spending allocations for necessities—food, campus transport, and what feel like excessively priced textbooks. This paints a clear picture of how students manage their money when digital methods replace physical cash.

The entire methodology felt like a checklist of unavoidable actions: concept generation, instrument creation, sampling, collection, and analysis were all followed rigidly. The discussion section, however, presents the real challenge, demanding interpretation and the creation of sound conclusions. We expect the data to provide some interesting results; otherwise, all the effort poured into this methodology section would have been entirely for nothing.
