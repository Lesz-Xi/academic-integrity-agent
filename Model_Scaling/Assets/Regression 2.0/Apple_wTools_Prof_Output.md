The growing concern regarding plastic waste has prompted schools to take proactive measures, particularly in campus cafeterias. These establishments contribute significantly to the accumulation of single-use plastic waste, which not only exacerbates the waste problem but also negatively impacts air quality.



At Mapúa MCM, we are considering replacing conventional plastic containers with compostable alternatives. However, this transition presents several challenges. The feasibility of the project hinges on factors such as budget constraints, the availability of appropriate composting facilities and transportation, and the willingness of students to adopt the new containers.



While some studies suggest that the long-term financial benefits may outweigh the initial costs associated with transitioning to compostable containers (Kaur & Acid, 2020), the upfront expenses for these containers can be substantial. Therefore, the decision for Mapúa MCM canteen involves weighing the potential long-term environmental benefits against the immediate financial and logistical challenges.



Furthermore, the success of this project depends on the students’ willingness to participate. While the concept of biodegradable materials may inspire positive intentions, the actual implementation of composting and proper cleaning practices requires active engagement. If students lack the necessary knowledge or motivation, the project’s effectiveness may be compromised.



In conclusion, this research aims to evaluate the financial implications of transitioning to compostable containers at the Mapúa MCM canteen. It seeks to assess the potential environmental benefits and determine the likelihood of student participation. This research is relevant to the broader context of schools striving for sustainability, as it highlights the complexities and challenges associated with implementing environmentally friendly initiatives.







In examining other regions, it becomes evident that the financial viability of compostable packaging varies. For instance, Middlebury University discovered that using compostable materials could yield a positive net present value over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Conversely, Canadian schools have advocated for perpetual washing and reusing of items, even if they are compostable, as a superior alternative to single-use options (Snyder & Park, 2024). The effectiveness of this approach depends on the frequency of use. Furthermore, utilizing plant-based materials aligns with the objectives of the green economy and aligns with the United Nations’ goals (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). However, cost and infrastructure remain significant challenges (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).



In the Philippines, compostable packaging presents promising prospects, but local considerations must be taken into account. One study indicated that biodegradable materials decompose within a month, which is significantly more efficient than the perpetual presence of plastic (Yao et al., 2024). Additionally, innovative blends of agricultural residues and bioplastics are being developed to promote the circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). However, the initial cost of production is typically higher due to the complexity of the manufacturing process. Nevertheless, potential savings on waste management fees and alignment with government green policies may offset the initial expenses (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). In Zamboanga, a reduction in plastic usage was observed following the implementation of compostable packaging, although there were complaints regarding the fragility of the new materials and a lack of acceptance among the public (Mohammad, 2024). Consequently, for Mapúa MCM, achieving an eco-friendly goal while adhering to budgetary constraints and ensuring student compliance with proper disposal practices presents a delicate balance.







To effectively address the complexities of this issue, we employ two primary theories: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).



**Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA):** CBA provides a structured approach to comparing the financial implications of adopting new containers. It evaluates the cost of the new containers against the potential savings from reduced waste disposal expenses, as well as the positive impact on the environment and the school’s reputation. CBA can determine whether the financial benefits outweigh the initial investment in the new packaging.



**Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB):** TPB focuses on the psychological factors influencing individuals’ decisions. It posits that an individual’s intention to perform a behavior is influenced by their attitudes towards the behavior, perceived behavioral control, and social influence. While the compostable route may offer significant financial savings for the school, if students perceive it as inconvenient or lack sufficient motivation, their adoption may be limited. By integrating CBA (financial considerations) with TPB (psychological factors), we can assess the feasibility of the switch in a real-world context.



However, there are still significant uncertainties, particularly for a school in the Philippines. Most research is conducted in other countries, which may not align with the school’s budget constraints or local waste management system. For instance, it is unclear whether the school has adequate bins for separating compostable materials. While TPB is a valuable framework, there is limited research on how Filipino students and staff respond to green initiatives. Canteen vendors, who are responsible for ordering, storage, and cost management, are often overlooked in these discussions. Additionally, while reusable products are frequently promoted as a solution, there is insufficient comparative research to determine whether they are superior to compostable options on a busy college campus. Furthermore, the impact of the school’s internal policies and local regulations on this issue remains unexplored.







In essence, this study aims to ascertain the feasibility of replacing plastic containers with compostable alternatives at the Mapúa MCM canteen. It is crucial to evaluate the long-term viability of this change for vendors and gain insights into the perspectives of students and teachers. Specifically, we should assess their attitudes towards the change, the extent of social pressure they may face, and their perceived ability to implement the transition. By considering both the financial and social aspects, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of whether this transition is financially sustainable, socially acceptable, and likely to endure, thereby achieving the ultimate objective of reducing plastic waste on campus.
