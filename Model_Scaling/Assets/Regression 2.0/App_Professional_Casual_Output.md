So, there’s a growing buzz about how plastic waste is hurting the environment, and schools aren’t off the hook. University canteens, like the one at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM), are being called out for relying heavily on single-use plastics. They pile up as trash and pump out greenhouse gases. People are now wondering if shifting to compostable food containers could be the fix—but it’s not as simple as just swapping plastics for “eco-friendly” alternatives.

Switching to compostable packaging sounds great, but it comes with a lot to think about. First, there’s the money side. Compostable materials usually cost more upfront, and schools like Mapúa MCM have to weigh if the long-term savings—like lower waste disposal fees—are worth it. Some studies do say that it could pay off in the long run, but the initial jump in expenses can make institutions hesitate.

Then there’s how people actually behave. Even if you provide compostable containers, will students and staff use them properly and dispose of them the right way? Research says eco-packaging can promote better habits, but there’s often a gap between what people say they’ll do for the planet and what they actually do.


Looking at global studies can help. Schools abroad have tried compostable service ware and, in some cases, even made it profitable over time. But there are also studies showing that reusable systems—like bringing your own containers—can beat single-use compostables both for the wallet and for the environment. Locally, compostable packaging can break down in about a month, which is great, but it’s still more expensive and needs proper facilities to handle the waste. Some local experiments, like those in Zamboanga City, show that while switching to alternatives cuts plastic use, there are still hiccups with cost, durability, and convenience.

This is where theory comes in. A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) can crunch the numbers to see if compostables make sense for Mapúa MCM’s canteen financially. Meanwhile, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) helps figure out if students and staff will actually support and follow through with this change. After all, even if the eco-friendly option is there, if people find it hassle or don’t care enough, the plan could flop.

Here in the Philippines, there’s still a lot we don’t know. Most studies about sustainable campus packaging come from other countries with better waste management systems. Local schools also face challenges like weak composting infrastructure and limited vendor awareness. Vendors, who are key players, often worry about costs, product strength, and supply availability. And while reusable options are on the table, no one has really compared their practicality versus compostables in campuses like Mapúa MCM.


At the end of the day, this study wants to figure out if replacing plastic with compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen is realistic. It’s about balancing the finances, the environmental benefits, and how people actually behave. If it works, the school could cut down on single-use plastics and take a real step toward sustainability.
