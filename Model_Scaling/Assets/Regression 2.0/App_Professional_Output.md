Everyone is focused on plastic waste now, and schools really need to step up, especially campus cafeterias. They use huge amounts of single-use plastic that piles up and hurts the environment. Here at Mapúa MCM, we are looking at replacing standard plastic containers with compostable ones, but that switch is a major headache. Will it actually work? What will it cost? Does it truly benefit the planet as claimed?

Switching to compostable materials is not an easy fix. We have to figure out the budget, whether we have the right bins and trucks for composting, and if students will even use the new containers correctly. Some research suggests this shift might save money eventually because trash hauling fees could drop (Kaur & Acid, 2020). However, the initial cost for the specialized containers is usually much higher. So, for the Mapúa MCM canteen, it’s a trade-off: are the long-term environmental benefits worth the immediate financial strain and logistical challenges?

Students generally like the idea of biodegradable items and it might encourage greener behavior (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). Intentions are one thing; actually remembering to compost or clean the items properly is another. If people do not care or lack knowledge, the entire program fails (Solsona, 2024). This project boils down to seriously examining the finances of dropping plastic for compostable options at the Mapúa MCM canteen, assessing the real environmental gain, and judging student willingness to participate. For us doing this research, it feels relevant because schools should be green, but we must be realistic about how expensive and difficult change can be.

Looking at what other institutions have done is helpful. Middlebury, for example, found that using compostable items could make financial sense over time, showing a positive net present value (Kaur & Acid, 2020). But some Canadian schools argue that washing and reusing items indefinitely is superior to any single-use option, even compostable ones, depending on the number of cycles (Snyder & Park, 2024). Using plant-based materials supports the green economy and aligns with UN goals, which is positive. Still, cost and infrastructure remain major obstacles (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippines, compostable packaging looks promising, but local conditions matter. One study reported that biodegradable items break down in about a month, far better than plastic permanence (Yao et al., 2024). They also highlighted using farm waste mixed with bioplastics to aid the circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). The difficulty is the higher initial manufacturing cost. If waste fees decrease later and government policies are met, the costs might balance out (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). A switch in Zamboanga showed reduced plastic use, but people still complained the new items broke easily or they disliked them (Mohammad, 2024). For Mapúa MCM, this means balancing environmental goals, budget constraints, and ensuring students do not just contaminate the compost bins with regular trash.

To organize this study, we are leaning on two main theoretical concepts. First is Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). This is a formal method to weigh the spending on new containers against savings from reduced trash disposal, plus the intangible value of improved school image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). CBA should reveal if the switch is financially sound long-term, despite high initial packaging prices.

The second framework is the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This focuses on people. It suggests that intentions are driven by personal attitudes, social influence, and perceived behavioral control—whether they feel able to act (Ajzen, 1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). Even if the compostable option saves the school significant money, if students find it inconvenient or lack motivation, proper use will not happen. By combining CBA (the financial perspective) with TPB (the behavioral perspective), we can assess the real-world feasibility of the change here.

There is still much we do not know, especially concerning a Philippine university setting. Most existing research comes from other countries and might not fit our specific budget limits or the local waste management structure at Mapúa MCM. Do we even have the proper separation bins? While TPB is a useful lens, few studies examine how Filipino students and staff actually respond to these green initiatives. We rarely interview canteen vendors, yet they manage ordering, storage, and daily cost issues. Furthermore, while reusable systems are often presented as the ideal, there is limited comparative research showing whether reusable is superior to compostable packaging specifically on a busy college campus. We also need to consider how existing school policies and municipal regulations affect this transition.

The goal of this study is simply to determine if replacing plastic with compostable containers at the Mapúa MCM canteen is realistic. We need to evaluate vendor feasibility long-term and deeply investigate student and faculty attitudes—their feelings, perceived social pressure, and sense of capability to change behavior. By looking at hard financial data alongside social factors, we should gain a clearer view on whether this transition is affordable, acceptable to the community, and sustainable over time, which is the ultimate aim of reducing campus plastic waste.
