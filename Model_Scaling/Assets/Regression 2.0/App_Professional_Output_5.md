The growing concern about plastic waste affecting the environment now includes educational institutions. University canteens, specifically the one at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM), face scrutiny for their heavy dependence on single-use plastics. These items accumulate as trash and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The public wonders if switching to compostable food containers offers a solution, though swapping plastics for so-called "eco-friendly" alternatives is never straightforward.

Adopting compostable packaging introduces several layers of complexity. Financial considerations are immediate. Compostable materials generally carry a higher initial price tag, forcing schools like Mapúa MCM to assess whether anticipated long-term savings, such as reduced waste disposal fees, justify the upfront expense. While some research suggests eventual payoff, this sudden increase in operating costs frequently causes institutions to hesitate.

User behavior presents another major variable. Even when compostable containers are provided, will students and staff commit to disposing of them correctly? Evidence indicates that eco-packaging *can* encourage better habits, but a well-documented gap often exists between stated environmental intentions and actual compliance in daily routines.

Examining international case studies offers perspective. Overseas institutions that implemented compostable service ware sometimes found profitability over time. However, other research indicates that reusable systems—encouraging patrons to bring their own containers—can outperform single-use compostables environmentally and financially. Locally, while compostable packaging breaks down within roughly a month, which is positive, it remains costlier and demands specialized waste management infrastructure. Local pilot programs, such as those in Zamboanga City, confirm that alternative packaging reduces plastic volume but still grapple with issues of expense, product fragility, and user convenience.

Theoretical frameworks help structure this evaluation. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) allows us to quantify whether compostables offer a sound financial case for the Mapúa MCM canteen. Concurrently, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) addresses the likelihood that students and staff will actively support and sustain the transition. After all, an environmentally sound option can easily fail if users find it inconvenient or simply lack the motivation to participate fully.

In the Philippine context, substantial knowledge gaps persist. Most studies regarding sustainable campus packaging originate in countries with established waste management systems. Local schools struggle with weak composting infrastructure and limited vendor understanding. Key stakeholders like vendors frequently express concern over procurement costs, material durability, and supply consistency. Furthermore, while reusable systems are an alternative, there has been little comparative assessment of their practicality versus compostables specifically within a setting like Mapúa MCM.

The objective of this research is determining the feasibility of substituting plastic with compostable packaging within the Mapúa MCM canteen. Success hinges on achieving equilibrium among financial viability, environmental gains, and predictable human response. If this shift proves workable, the school could significantly decrease its reliance on single-use plastics and advance its sustainability commitment.
