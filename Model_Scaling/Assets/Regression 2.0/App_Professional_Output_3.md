The current panic over plastic waste makes it clear that schools, especially campus cafeterias, need to adjust their habits. Mapúa MCM is looking closely at replacing single-use plastic containers with compostable alternatives, but honestly, this shift presents immediate headaches. Will the system actually function? What will the initial financial hit be? Does this move truly provide the environmental benefit claimed?

Implementing a switch to compostable items is not a simple fix. The administration must address the budget, secure the necessary composting bins and collection services, and ensure users properly sort the waste. Some research suggests that this change could eventually reduce long-term waste hauling expenses (Kaur & Acid, 2020). For the Mapúa MCM canteen right now, however, the upfront price tag for specialized containers is usually much higher. This creates a fundamental trade-off: do the potential long-term environmental gains outweigh the immediate budgetary strain and logistical complications?

Student buy-in presents its own layer of complexity. While many students support the concept of biodegradable materials and show a general willingness to act greener (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), stated intentions often differ from actual behavior. If students fail to sort materials correctly or lack the knowledge to compost properly, the entire initiative can fail (Solsona, 2024). Therefore, this project necessitates a deep analysis of the financial implications of ditching plastic for compostables at Mapúa MCM, an assessment of the real environmental payoff, and a gauge of student compliance. For us conducting this research, the relevance is high; schools must embrace sustainability, but we need a realistic view of the costs and implementation challenges involved.

Examining what other institutions have done offers some context. Middlebury College, for instance, found that utilizing compostable products could become financially viable over time, suggesting a positive net present value (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Conversely, some Canadian institutions argue that investing in reusable systems is superior to any single-use option, regardless of its compostable status, depending heavily on usage frequency (Snyder & Park, 2024). Plant-derived materials align well with broader green economy goals and UN objectives, which is a plus. Still, cost and existing infrastructure remain significant obstacles nationwide (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippines, compostable packaging shows promise, but local conditions must be evaluated. One local study reported that biodegradable items degrade in about a month, a vast improvement over conventional plastic persistence (Yao et al., 2024). Researchers here are also exploring mixes of agricultural waste and bioplastics to bolster the circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). The primary drawback remains higher initial manufacturing costs. If savings on waste disposal fees and compliance with government green mandates balance out these expenses, the transition might work (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). A switch in Zamboanga showed reduced plastic use, though users reported issues with the new materials breaking easily or simply disliking the change (Mohammad, 2024). For Mapúa MCM, the balancing act involves environmental aspiration, budgetary restraint, and managing student adoption rates.

To structure this evaluation, we are relying on two main theoretical frameworks, which lend an academic underpinning to the practical issues. The first is Cost-Benefit Analysis, or CBA. This provides a formal method for weighing the expense of purchasing new containers against projected savings from reduced waste disposal fees, factoring in the intangible benefits like improved public image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). CBA should clarify if the switch is financially sound in the long term, even factoring in higher immediate packaging expenses.

The second framework is the Theory of Planned Behavior, or TPB. This focuses on human agency, suggesting that an individual’s behavioral intention is driven by their beliefs about the action, subjective social norms, and their perceived capability to perform the behavior (Ajzen, 1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). Even if the compostable option saves the school substantial money, student rejection due to perceived inconvenience or lack of motivation will doom the effort. By integrating CBA (the financial reality) with TPB (the human factor), we can better assess the practical viability of this change within our specific campus setting.

Significant gaps in current knowledge remain, particularly for a Philippine context. Much of the existing literature originates internationally and may not align with local budget constraints or the specific structure of waste management at Mapúa MCM. For example, we have not confirmed the availability of necessary separation bins. While TPB is a useful lens, few studies have specifically examined how Filipino students and staff respond to these kinds of institutional green initiatives. The canteen vendors, who manage daily ordering and storage, are also rarely consulted regarding cost impacts. Furthermore, while reusables are often proposed as the ideal solution, direct comparative research quantifying whether reusables outperform compostables in a high-volume college setting is lacking. We also need to account for how internal school policies interact with existing municipal regulations.

Ultimately, this study aims to determine the true feasibility of substituting plastic with compostable containers at Mapúa MCM. We must evaluate the long-term practicality for vendors and conduct a thorough investigation into student and faculty attitudes—their beliefs, perceived social pressure, and sense of self-efficacy regarding the change. By examining both the concrete financial data and the social dynamics, we should gain a much clearer understanding of whether the transition is affordable, acceptable to the community, and sustainable enough to achieve the goal of reducing campus plastic waste.
