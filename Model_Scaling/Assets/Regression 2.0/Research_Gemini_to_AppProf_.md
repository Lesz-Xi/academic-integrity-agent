In the execution of this project, we adhered to a standard methodology. Our approach involved a comprehensive plan, essentially a step-by-step guide to ensure the accuracy of our data collection process. Adherence to the established procedures was crucial, as it directly impacted our academic performance.
Initially, we identified the research question that would guide our investigation. We sought to address a gap in the existing knowledge regarding the impact of mobile wallet usage on student spending behavior. While digital money is widely recognized, the extent to which mobile wallets influence student spending remains unclear. Our focus was on determining whether excessive reliance on mobile wallets, such as GCash, contributes to financial difficulties among students.
To substantiate our research, we conducted a thorough literature review, encompassing both global and local sources. We prioritized online resources that were accessible without paywalls. To lend credibility to our findings, we incorporated the “Financial Behavioral Theory” developed by Barberis and Thaler in 2003. This theory posits that individuals may not always make rational financial decisions. By applying this theory, we were able to frame our research problem effectively: the ease of use of e-wallets, particularly mobile wallets like Maya and GCash, may lead to impulsive spending and hinder students’ ability to save for tuition.
For the survey, we opted to utilize a pre-existing questionnaire structure from a previous study conducted by Shivranjani R. in 2022. This study focused on online shopping behavior. While we retained the Likert scale used in the original questionnaire, which facilitates easy grading, we modified the shopping-related questions to reflect our specific research focus. We replaced the shopping questions with inquiries about the frequency of student usage of Maya and GCash and their ability to track their daily expenses. We believe that these modifications accounted for approximately 30% of the questionnaire, ensuring its originality.
The subsequent phase entailed the arduous task of recruiting participants for the survey. We employed a methodology known as purposive sampling, which may sound more sophisticated than it actually is. Essentially, this approach involved selecting individuals who met our specific criteria. We were not surveying professors or random individuals from the public. Instead, we sought first-year students enrolled in our particular class, ENG024, at MCM. Furthermore, these students were required to utilize e-wallets on a regular basis. Failure to use GCash resulted in disqualification. Our objective was to obtain genuine and honest feedback, not merely speculative guesses. Consequently, we only managed to secure the participation of 30 individuals, which may have appeared small, but for a limited study, 30 is preferable to five. Our primary requirement was for participants to possess the ability to articulate their daily financial management strategies.
The collection of actual data proved to be the most straightforward aspect, fortunately. We utilized Google Forms, as it eliminates the need for manual data entry from printed documents. We distributed the link during the second week of the respective academic cycle. The paramount consideration in this process was ethical conduct. This entailed assuring participants that their responses would remain confidential and anonymous. We presented the consent form to inform them of the nature of their participation, and subsequently, we awaited the notifications. It is imperative to safeguard the privacy of students’ financial information, particularly regarding their expenditures on street food.
Upon receiving the 30 responses—which arrived gradually—we commenced the data cleaning process. Data cleaning involves ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data collected. We meticulously reviewed each response to verify that no erroneous entries, such as “ten million dollars” in the field designated for monthly allowance, were present. Additionally, we confirmed that all required fields were adequately filled out. If a participant omitted the question pertaining to transportation budgeting, we either discarded the entire survey or marked that specific response as missing.
Finally, we conducted an analysis. Given the limited sample size of 30 individuals, we were unable to employ advanced machine learning techniques. Instead, we opted for “quantitative descriptive analysis,” focusing on basic statistical measures such as mean, median, and mode. Our objective was to gain insights into the financial behavior of the students. Specifically, we sought to determine the percentage of individuals who utilize GCash more frequently than Maya, as well as the frequency of weekly expenditures exceeding 500 pesos. We analyzed the data to identify the typical spending patterns for essential expenses, including food, transportation to campus, and the purchase of school textbooks, which are often priced excessively. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the students’ financial allocation when they have the option to use digital payment methods instead of traditional currency.
The entire methodology process felt like a series of necessary steps to complete the section. Conceptualization, instrument design, sampling, data collection, and analysis were all meticulously followed. However, the discussion section presents a more challenging task, as it requires the interpretation of the data and the formulation of meaningful conclusions. We anticipate that the data will yield interesting insights, as otherwise, the time and effort invested in the methodology section would have been wasted.
