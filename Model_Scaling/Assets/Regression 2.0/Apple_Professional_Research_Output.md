In executing this project, we adhered to a standardized methodology, essentially a step-by-step guide designed to ensure the accuracy of our data collection. Following these established procedures was crucial, as our final academic marks were directly dependent on it.



The investigation commenced by isolating the core research question. Our objective was to elucidate the existing knowledge gap regarding the impact of mobile wallet usage on student spending habits. While digital currency is widely recognized, the extent to which specific mobile wallets influence student consumption remains unclear. Our specific focus was determining whether an excessive reliance on services such as GCash contributes to financial strain among students.



To substantiate our work, we conducted a literature review utilizing both global and local databases. We specifically prioritized online sources devoid of paywalls. To lend credibility to our findings, we incorporated Barberis and Thaler’s 2003 “Financial Behavioral Theory.” This framework posits that individuals frequently make financially irrational decisions. Employing this perspective, we framed our problem: the inherent convenience of e-wallets, particularly Maya and GCash, may incentivize impulsive purchasing and hinder tuition savings.



For the survey instrument, we adapted a pre-existing questionnaire structure from a 2022 study by Shivranjani R., which focused on online shopping. We retained the user-friendly Likert scale for straightforward grading, but we significantly modified the content. We replaced the shopping inquiries with questions measuring the frequency of Maya and GCash usage and participants’ ability to track daily expenditures. These modifications accounted for approximately 30% of the final questionnaire, ensuring the creation of a novel instrument.







Recruiting participants proved to be the next, albeit challenging, phase. We employed purposive sampling, a term perhaps more impressive than the process itself. This involved selecting only individuals who precisely met our requirements—not professors or random citizens. We strictly targeted first-year students enrolled in our specific course, ENG024, at MCM, who also utilized e-wallets regularly. A student who never used GCash was automatically disqualified. We sought genuine feedback, not speculation. This strictness limited us to only 30 participants, a small number, but thirty is certainly preferable to five for a focused study. The primary requirement was the participant’s capacity to articulate their daily financial management strategies.



Fortunately, the actual data collection was the simplest part. We deployed Google Forms, avoiding the mess of manual entry from paper copies. We circulated the link during the second week of the academic cycle. Ethical conduct was the chief concern during distribution. This meant guaranteeing anonymity and confidentiality. We presented a consent form detailing the participation requirements, then waited for submissions. Protecting students’ private financial data, particularly expenditures on inexpensive street food, is crucial.



Once the 30 responses trickled in, we commenced data cleaning. This involved verifying completeness and accuracy. We checked every submission for obvious errors, such as someone entering “ten million dollars” for their monthly allowance, and confirmed that all mandatory fields were addressed. If a participant omitted the question on transportation budgeting, we either discarded the entire survey or flagged that specific answer as missing.







The final step in the research process was analysis. Given the limited sample size of 30, advanced machine learning techniques were not feasible. Consequently, we opted for “quantitative descriptive analysis,” focusing on fundamental statistical measures such as mean, median, and mode. Our objective was to gain insights into student financial behaviors. Specifically, we sought to determine the ratio of GCash reliance to Maya usage and identify the frequency of weekly spending exceeding 500 pesos. Additionally, we identified typical patterns for essential expenses, including food, commuting to campus, and the purchase of frequently overpriced textbooks. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how students allocate their funds when faced with the choice between digital payment and cash.







The entire methodology appeared to be a sequential process, requiring meticulous attention to detail. Conceptualization, instrument design, sampling, data collection, and analysis were all executed with strict adherence to the established procedures. However, the discussion section presents a more challenging aspect, demanding interpretation and the formulation of robust conclusions. We anticipate that the data will yield intriguing results, as otherwise, the significant effort invested in this methodology section would have been in vain.
