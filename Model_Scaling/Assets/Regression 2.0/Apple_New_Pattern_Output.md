The execution of this project necessitated adherence to a standardized methodology, essentially a sequential roadmap designed to ensure data collection accuracy. Compliance with these established procedures was imperative, as it directly correlated with our academic performance metrics.



Initially, we isolated the central research question guiding our investigation. The objective was to address a recognized knowledge gap regarding the impact of mobile wallet usage on student spending habits. While digital money is prevalent, the extent to which e-wallets influence actual student expenditure remains ambiguous. Our specific interest centered on whether an excessive reliance on services such as GCash leads students to financial strain.



To support the analysis, we conducted an extensive literature review, prioritizing accessible online materials over paywalled journals, both domestically and internationally. We grounded our findings in the 2003 “Financial Behavioral Theory” by Barberis and Thaler, which posits that individuals frequently bypass perfectly rational financial decision-making processes. By applying this framework, we effectively framed the problem: the inherent convenience of mobile wallets, such as Maya and GCash, often facilitates impulsive purchasing, thereby undermining student savings for tuition.



For the survey instrument, we repurposed a pre-existing questionnaire structure from a 2022 study by Shivranjani R. that focused on general online shopping behavior. We retained the convenient Likert scale format for ease of grading, but we significantly adapted the content. The shopping-specific inquiries were overhauled to align with our focus, shifting to questions regarding the frequency of Maya and GCash usage and the students’ self-reported ability to track daily expenditures. These necessary modifications accounted for approximately 30% of the final instrument, ensuring adequate originality.



The subsequent challenge entailed the arduous recruitment of participants. We employed purposive sampling, a term that may appear intricate, but essentially entails selecting individuals who align with specific predetermined criteria. We were not surveying faculty or random citizens. Instead, we required active first-year students enrolled in our designated section, ENG024, at MCM, who also utilized e-wallets on a regular basis. Individuals who did not use GCash were immediately disqualified. We sought authentic feedback, not conjecture, which unfortunately restricted our final pool to 30 individuals. While small, thirty responses are certainly preferable to five for a narrowly defined study. The primary qualification was the participant’s ability to articulate their current daily money management routines.



Fortunately, the actual data collection phase was the most straightforward aspect of the entire process. We utilized Google Forms, eliminating the tedious labor of transcribing paper surveys. We distributed the link during the second week of the relevant academic period. Confidentiality and anonymity were the primary ethical considerations in this regard. We presented a consent form outlining the nature of participation, and then awaited responses. Protecting students’ financial privacy, particularly concerning minor expenditures such as street food, remains paramount.



Upon receiving the 30 responses, we commenced the data cleaning protocol. This entails verifying the completeness and accuracy of the data. We manually verified each entry, discarding erroneous inputs, such as an individual listing a monthly allowance of “ten million dollars,” and ensuring that all required fields were completed. If a participant omitted the question regarding budgeting for transportation, we either flagged the entire survey or marked that specific answer as missing.



The concluding phase entailed analysis. Given the limited sample size of 30, advanced machine learning was deemed impractical. Consequently, we opted for quantitative descriptive analysis, employing fundamental statistics such as mean, median, and mode to obtain a concise overview of student financial habits. We specifically targeted metrics: the percentage of students who favored GCash over Maya and the frequency of weekly spending exceeding the 500-peso threshold. This analysis facilitated the identification of typical spending allocations for essential expenses, including food, campus transportation, and textbooks that appear to be excessively priced. This analysis provides a clear picture of how students manage their finances when digital methods replace physical cash.



The entire methodology adhered to a structured checklist of unavoidable actions: concept generation, instrument creation, sampling, data collection, and analysis were all meticulously followed. However, the discussion section presents the true challenge, requiring interpretation and the formulation of sound conclusions. We anticipate that the data will yield intriguing results; otherwise, the substantial effort invested in this methodology section would have been in vain.
