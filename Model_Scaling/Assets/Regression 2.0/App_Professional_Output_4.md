The current panic over plastic waste is huge, and schools need to respond. Campus cafeterias, in particular, generate massive amounts of single-use plastic that just piles up and pollutes the environment. Here at Mapúa MCM, we are considering replacing standard plastic containers with compostable alternatives, but the logistics feel like a real headache. Will this actually work? What is the budget impact? Does this transition deliver the environmental benefits we expect?

Switching to compostable materials is not a simple fix. We have to account for the budget, secure the necessary composting bins and hauling services, and ensure people use the new containers correctly. Some research suggests that adopting composting might lead to long-term savings by cutting down on landfill fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Right now, though, the initial purchase price for these specialized containers is usually much higher. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this means weighing the long-term environmental payoff against immediate financial strain and operational snags.

Students seem receptive to biodegradable options and are generally supportive of greener practices (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). Still, good intentions do not guarantee correct action; remembering to compost or rinse containers properly is a separate issue. If students lack awareness or motivation, the entire system can fail (Solsona, 2024). This whole project, then, requires a deep dive into the finances of ditching plastic for compostable ware in our canteen, assessing the true environmental gains, and determining student compliance levels. For us conducting this research, the relevance is clear: schools should be sustainable, but we must be realistic about the difficulty and expense of real change.

Looking at what other institutions have done offers some guidance. Middlebury, for instance, found that using compostable items could become financially sound over time, suggesting a positive net present value (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Other schools in Canada argue that a robust washing and reuse system beats any single-use option, even compostable ones, depending on the cycle count (Snyder & Park, 2024). Using plant-based materials aligns well with developing a green economy and meeting UN sustainability goals, which is beneficial. Cost and infrastructure gaps remain significant obstacles, though (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippines, compostable packaging shows potential, but local conditions need scrutiny. One study noted that biodegradable materials break down in about a month, a vast improvement over permanent plastic waste (Yao et al., 2024). Researchers here are also experimenting with mixes of agricultural waste and bioplastics to boost the circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). The main issue is the higher initial cost associated with specialized manufacturing. Balancing this against future savings on waste disposal fees and compliance with government green mandates could make it worthwhile (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). A transition in Zamboanga, while reducing plastic volume, resulted in complaints that the new packaging was flimsy or simply disliked by users (Mohammad, 2024). Mapúa MCM must therefore walk a fine line between ecological aspiration, budget constraints, and preventing students from defaulting to the regular trash bin.

To organize our approach to this complexity, we rely on two established theoretical models. The first is Cost-Benefit Analysis, or CBA, which provides a structured method to compare the expense of purchasing new containers against savings from reduced waste collection, plus the intangible value of improved public image (Mishan & Quah, 2020). CBA should clarify if the switch is financially sound in the long term, even with high upfront costs.

The second model is the Theory of Planned Behavior, or TPB. This framework focuses on user action, suggesting that behavioral intent is determined by an individual's attitude, subjective norms (peer influence), and perceived behavioral control (Ajzen, 1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). Even if the school saves money, if students find the new system inconvenient or fail to feel capable of using it correctly, compliance will fail. By integrating CBA (the financial assessment) with TPB (the human element), we can gauge the true viability of this operational shift on our campus.

Significant gaps remain, particularly concerning the specific context of a Philippine institution. Much of the existing research originates from international settings that may not align with our local budget realities or waste management infrastructure here at Mapúa MCM. We need to confirm the availability of the proper sorting bins for compostables. While TPB is a helpful guide, few studies have specifically explored how Filipino students and staff react to these campus greening initiatives. Furthermore, we are overlooking the canteen vendors who manage ordering, storage, and pricing daily. There is also a lack of direct comparative research showing whether reusable systems definitively outperform compostable single-use items in a busy college setting. We also need to examine how internal school policies and municipal regulations impact the overall process.

This study ultimately seeks to determine the realism of replacing plastic containers with compostable ones at Mapúa MCM. We must assess the long-term feasibility for vendors and thoroughly investigate the attitudes, perceived social pressure, and self-efficacy of students and faculty regarding the required behavioral change. By examining both the hard financial data and the social dynamics, we should gain a clearer understanding of whether the transition is affordable, likely to be accepted by the community, and sustainable enough to achieve lasting waste reduction on campus.
