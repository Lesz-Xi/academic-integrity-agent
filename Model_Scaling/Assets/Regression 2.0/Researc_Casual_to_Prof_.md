We executed this project by adhering to a standardized methodology, essentially a step-by-step guide designed to safeguard the accuracy of our data collection. Following these established procedures was essential; our final academic marks depended directly upon it.

The investigation began by isolating the core research question. We aimed to clarify the existing knowledge gap concerning how mobile wallet usage affects student spending habits. Digital currency is common knowledge, but the degree to which specific mobile wallets steer student consumption remains vague. Our specific target was determining if an over-reliance on services like GCash contributes to financial strain for students.

To ground the work, we conducted a literature review pulling from both global and local databases. We specifically prioritized online sources free of paywalls. Lending necessary credibility, we incorporated Barberis and Thaler’s 2003 “Financial Behavioral Theory.” This framework suggests people frequently make financially irrational choices. Using this lens, we framed our problem: the sheer convenience of e-wallets, especially Maya and GCash, might encourage impulse buying and sabotage tuition savings.

For the survey instrument, we adapted a pre-existing questionnaire structure from a 2022 study by Shivranjani R., which focused on online shopping. We kept the user-friendly Likert scale for straightforward grading, but we significantly modified the content. We swapped out the shopping inquiries for questions measuring the frequency of Maya and GCash use and participants' ability to track daily expenditures. These modifications accounted for about 30% of the final questionnaire, ensuring a novel instrument.

Recruiting participants proved to be the next, rather arduous, phase. We used purposive sampling, a term perhaps more impressive than the process itself. This involved selecting only individuals who precisely fit our needs—not professors or random citizens. We strictly targeted first-year students enrolled in our specific course, ENG024, at MCM, who also used e-wallets regularly. A student who never used GCash was automatically disqualified. We needed genuine feedback, not speculation. This strictness limited us to just 30 participants, a small number, but thirty is certainly preferable to five for a focused study. The primary requirement was the participant's capacity to articulate their daily financial management strategies.

Fortunately, the actual data collection was the simplest part. We deployed Google Forms, avoiding the mess of manual entry from paper copies. We circulated the link during the second week of the academic cycle. Ethical conduct was the chief concern during distribution. This meant guaranteeing anonymity and confidentiality. We presented a consent form detailing the participation requirements, then waited for submissions. Protecting students' private financial data, especially expenditures on inexpensive street food, is crucial.

Once the 30 responses trickled in, we began data cleaning. This involved verifying completeness and accuracy. We checked every submission for obvious errors, like someone entering “ten million dollars” for their monthly allowance, and confirmed that all mandatory fields were addressed. If a participant skipped the question on transportation budgeting, we either tossed the whole survey or flagged that specific answer as missing.

The final step was analysis. Given the small sample of 30, advanced machine learning techniques were off the table. We settled on “quantitative descriptive analysis,” sticking to basics like mean, median, and mode. Our goal was illuminating student financial habits. Specifically, we wanted to know the ratio of GCash reliance versus Maya use, and how often weekly spending topped 500 pesos. We mapped typical patterns for essential costs: food, commuting to campus, and the purchase of notoriously overpriced textbooks. This analysis offers a clear look at how students allocate funds when they have the option of digital payment over cash.

The entire methodology felt like a necessary sequence of boxes to tick. Conceptualization, instrument design, sampling, data collection, and analysis were all followed rigidly. However, the discussion section promises to be harder, demanding interpretation and the formation of solid conclusions. We expect the data to provide interesting results, because otherwise, all the effort spent on this methodology section would have been for nothing.
