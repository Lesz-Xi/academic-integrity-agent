The investigation began by isolating the core research question. The study aimed to clarify the existing knowledge gap concerning how mobile wallet usage affects student spending habits. Digital currency is widely recognized, but the degree to which specific mobile wallets steer student consumption remains underexplored. The specific target was determining if an over-reliance on services like GCash contributes to financial strain for students.

To ground the work, the researchers conducted a literature review pulling from both global and local databases. They specifically prioritized online open-access sources. Lending necessary credibility, the study incorporated Barberis and Thaler's 2003 "Financial Behavioral Theory." This framework suggests people frequently make financially irrational choices. Using this lens, the study framed the problem: the sheer convenience of e-wallets, especially Maya and GCash, might encourage impulse buying and undermine tuition savings.


For the survey instrument, a pre-existing questionnaire structure from a 2022 study by Shivranjani R., which focused on online shopping, was adapted. The user-friendly Likert scale for consistent measurement was kept, but the content was significantly modified. The shopping inquiries were replaced with questions measuring the frequency of Maya and GCash use and participants' ability to track daily expenditures. These modifications accounted for about 30% of the final questionnaire, ensuring a novel instrument.

Recruiting participants comprised the subsequent phase. Purposive sampling, involving the selection of individuals who precisely fit the needs, was used. Only first-year students enrolled in the specific course, ENG024, at MCM, who also used e-wallets regularly, were targeted. A student who never used GCash was automatically disqualified to ensure genuine feedback. This strictness limited the participants to 30. This sample size was preferable for a focused study. The primary requirement was the participant's capacity to articulate their daily financial management strategies.

The actual data collection was conducted systematically. Google Forms was deployed, avoiding the potential for errors from manual entry. The link was circulated during the second week of the academic cycle. Ethical conduct was the chief concern during distribution, ensuring anonymity and confidentiality. A consent form detailing the participation requirements was presented, and submissions were awaited. Protecting students' private financial data, especially expenditures on daily food expenditures, was crucial.


Once the 30 responses were received, data cleaning commenced. This involved verifying completeness and accuracy. Every submission was checked for obvious errors, such as unrealistic monthly allowance amounts, and ensuring all mandatory fields were addressed. If a participant skipped a question, the specific answer was flagged as missing.

The final step was analysis. Given the small sample size of 30, advanced machine learning techniques were outside the scope of this descriptive study. Quantitative descriptive analysis was employed, focusing on measures like mean, median, and mode. The goal was to illuminate student financial habits, specifically the ratio of GCash reliance versus Maya use, and the frequency of weekly spending exceeding 500 pesos. Typical patterns for essential costs, including food, commuting, and textbook purchases, were mapped.

The entire methodology followed a rigorous sequence of conceptualization, instrument design, sampling, data collection, and analysis. While the discussion section promises to be requiring careful analysis, requiring interpretation and solid conclusions, the data is expected to provide meaningful results.
