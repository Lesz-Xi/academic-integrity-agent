The current issue of plastic waste has garnered significant attention, and institutions, such as university campuses, must take decisive action to address this growing concern. Campus cafeterias, in particular, represent a significant contributor to the problem due to their heavy reliance on single-use plastic items, which contribute to the accumulation of waste and environmental degradation.

In the case of Mapúa MCM, the institution is considering the implementation of compostable containers to replace the existing plastic counterparts. However, this transition is not without its challenges. The financial implications and logistical considerations must be carefully evaluated to determine the feasibility and long-term sustainability of such a change. The upfront costs associated with the procurement of compostable containers may be higher than the current plastic options, which raises concerns about the budgetary impact.

Moreover, the successful implementation of a compostable system requires the availability of appropriate infrastructure, such as dedicated waste collection and processing facilities. The researchers must assess whether the current waste management systems at Mapúa MCM are equipped to handle the transition to compostable materials effectively.

Additionally, the study must consider the behavioral aspects of the student population. While the concept of biodegradable containers may be appealing, the actual usage and proper disposal of these items by the students are critical factors in determining the environmental benefits. The researchers must investigate the level of student engagement and awareness regarding proper waste management practices to ensure the success of the initiative.

Overall, the decision to replace plastic with compostable containers in the Mapúa MCM canteen requires a comprehensive evaluation of the financial, logistical, and behavioral implications. The researchers must carefully analyze the trade-offs between the potential environmental benefits and the short-term challenges to make an informed decision that aligns with the institution's sustainability goals.


The existing literature provides insights into the feasibility of implementing compostable packaging in academic institutions. A study at Middlebury found that using compostable materials can have a positive net present value over time, suggesting potential financial viability (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Conversely, Canadian schools have indicated that reusing and washing materials may be preferable to single-use options, even compostable ones, as the number of reuses is a critical factor (Snyder & Park, 2024).

The use of plant-based materials aligns with the goals of the green economy and the United Nations' objectives, which is a positive consideration (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). However, cost and infrastructure remain significant challenges. In the Philippines, compostable packaging shows promise, with studies demonstrating rapid biodegradation compared to plastic (Yao et al., 2024). Innovative mixes of farm materials and bioplastics have also been explored to support the circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Nevertheless, the higher upfront costs of these solutions can be a barrier, though potential savings on waste fees and alignment with green policies may help offset this (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Experiences in Zamboanga indicate that while the switch to compostable packaging reduced plastic usage, there were concerns about the durability and acceptability of the new materials (Mohammad, 2024).

To evaluate the feasibility of compostable packaging at Mapúa MCM, a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) will be conducted. This formal approach will compare the expenditures on the new packaging with the savings from reduced waste disposal, as well as the potential benefits of environmental stewardship and institutional reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). The CBA should provide insights into the long-term financial viability of transitioning to compostable alternatives.


The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is another significant theoretical framework in this domain. According to Ajzen (1991), as cited in Sarmah and Singh (2024), the intention to perform a particular behavior is determined by one's attitudes towards the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Thus, even if the compostable alternative offers substantial cost savings for the school, if students perceive it as inconvenient or do not feel strongly motivated, they may not adopt the new system. By integrating cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the study aims to assess the feasibility of the transition in the real-world context.

However, there are several knowledge gaps that need to be addressed, particularly in the context of the Philippines and the Mapúa MCM campus. Most of the existing research has been conducted in different countries, which may not accurately reflect the budgetary constraints or the local waste management infrastructure. Additionally, there is limited empirical evidence on how Filipino students and staff would react to such green initiatives. The perspectives of canteen vendors, who are directly responsible for ordering, storage, and cost management, have also been largely overlooked. Furthermore, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive comparison of the efficacy of reusable versus compostable alternatives in a busy college campus setting.

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the viability of replacing plastic containers with compostable alternatives in the Mapúa MCM canteen. The researchers aim to assess the long-term feasibility for the vendors, as well as to deeply examine the attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control of students and faculty. By considering both the financial and the social factors, the study seeks to provide a more holistic understanding of whether this transition is financially viable, socially acceptable, and likely to be sustained over time, which is essential for effectively reducing plastic waste on the campus.
