Growing concern over plastic pollution has placed increasing pressure on institutions to look for more sustainable packaging alternatives. University canteens, in particular, are under scrutiny because of their heavy reliance on single-use plastics, which significantly contribute to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Solsona, 2024). In the context of Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM), the idea of shifting from conventional plastic food containers to compostable alternatives raises important questions about cost, feasibility, and genuine environmental impact.

Adopting compostable packaging is not a straightforward decision. It involves balancing financial constraints, infrastructure readiness, and consumer acceptance. Some studies suggest that compostable options may result in long-term savings due to reduced waste disposal costs (Kaur & Acid, 2020). However, institutions often hesitate because of the higher upfront costs of these materials. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this means carefully weighing whether the long-term environmental and economic benefits outweigh the immediate operational and financial challenges.

Consumer perception also plays a critical role. Research indicates that biodegradable and compostable materials can encourage environmentally responsible behavior (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025), but their success largely depends on awareness and active participation from users. A common issue is the gap between environmental intentions and actual behavior, which can undermine sustainability initiatives if not properly addressed (Solsona, 2024). This study therefore focuses on evaluating the costs and benefits of transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen, taking into account financial implications, environmental outcomes, and behavioral factors. From the perspective of student-researchers, this topic is both timely and necessary, as it highlights how educational institutions can promote sustainability while confronting real-world limitations such as cost and implementation barriers.

International studies provide useful insights into this issue. Research conducted at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that compostable food service ware (CSFW) can be economically viable over time, often yielding positive Net Present Values (NPVs) (Kaur & Acid, 2020). On the other hand, studies from Canada suggest that reusable packaging systems may outperform single-use compostable options both economically and environmentally, emphasizing the importance of usage frequency in sustainability assessments (Snyder & Park, 2024). Additional research shows that bioplastics and renewable materials support green economic practices and align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, although challenges related to cost, usability, and infrastructure remain (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippine context, compostable packaging also presents promising potential but requires careful evaluation. Yao et al. (2024) reported that biodegradable materials can decompose within approximately one month, significantly reducing plastic waste. Innovations such as StrawPlast, which combines agricultural fibers with bioplastics, offer opportunities to support a circular economy and lessen environmental harm (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). Despite these advantages, biodegradable packaging often remains more expensive than conventional plastics due to production costs and the need for specialized technology. Nevertheless, long-term benefits may emerge through lower waste management expenses and compliance with sustainability policies (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Local research from Zamboanga City supports these findings, showing reduced plastic consumption when alternatives are introduced, but also highlighting persistent issues related to durability, usability, and consumer acceptance (Mohammad, 2024). These findings suggest that for institutions like the Mapúa MCM canteen, transitioning to compostable packaging requires a careful balance between environmental goals, financial limitations, and actual user behavior.

To guide this transition, the study draws on two key theoretical frameworks: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). CBA provides a systematic way to compare the costs of compostable packaging with its potential benefits, such as reduced waste disposal expenses, environmental improvements, and enhanced institutional reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). Applied to the Mapúa MCM canteen, this framework helps determine whether the transition produces a positive net value over time despite higher material costs. Meanwhile, Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior explains how attitudes, perceived social pressure, and perceived behavioral control shape individuals’ intentions and actions (Ajzen, 1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). Even if compostable packaging is economically justified, negative perceptions regarding convenience or low environmental concern among consumers could hinder adoption. Combining these frameworks allows the study to assess both economic feasibility and social acceptance, offering a more comprehensive understanding of whether the transition can succeed in practice.

Despite growing interest in sustainable packaging, significant research gaps remain, particularly in the context of Philippine educational institutions. Much of the existing literature is based on international settings and may not fully reflect local conditions such as economic constraints, limited waste management infrastructure, or campus-specific behaviors at Mapúa MCM. There is also limited research on whether schools have adequate systems for waste segregation and composting. Additionally, while behavioral frameworks like TPB are widely used, few studies examine how Filipino students, staff, and vendors perceive and respond to sustainability initiatives. Canteen vendors, in particular, are often overlooked despite their central role in implementation and their concerns regarding cost, durability, and supply chains. Although reusable packaging is frequently proposed as an alternative, comparative studies assessing its practicality versus compostable options in campus settings are still scarce. The influence of institutional policies and local regulations also warrants closer examination.

Ultimately, this study aims to assess the practicality of replacing plastic packaging with compostable alternatives in the Mapúa MCM canteen. It seeks to evaluate long-term feasibility for vendors while examining the attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived behavioral control of students and faculty toward adopting sustainable practices. By considering both economic realities and social dynamics, the research aims to provide a clearer basis for determining whether such a transition is affordable, acceptable, and sustainable in the long run, thereby supporting efforts to reduce single-use plastic consumption on campus.
