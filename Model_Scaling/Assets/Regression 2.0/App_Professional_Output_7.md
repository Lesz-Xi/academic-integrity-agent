The escalating global concern regarding plastic waste necessitates immediate and decisive action from educational institutions. Campus dining facilities, in particular, contribute substantially to this issue due to their extensive utilization of disposable plastic materials, which exacerbates landfill accumulation and negatively impacts air quality. Specifically, within the context of Mapúa MCM, the proposed transition from conventional plastic food service containers to compostable alternatives presents considerable logistical complexities. Critical evaluation is required to ascertain the feasibility of this substitution, determine the associated financial implications, and verify the projected environmental efficacy of such a measure.


Making the switch to stuff that composts isn't some easy button, man. You gotta figure out the budget, if we even have the right bins and trucks for composting, and if people will actually use the new containers right. Some papers say, eventually, it might save money because we won't have to pay as much to haul away trash (Kaur & Acid, 2020). But right now? The upfront cost for the fancy new containers is usually way higher. So for the Mapúa MCM canteen, it’s just this big trade-off: are the long-term green points worth the short-term money problems and logistics nightmares?


And then there are the students. People seem to like the idea of biodegradable stuff and it might make them act a little greener (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). But, I mean, intentions are one thing, actually remembering to compost it or wash it properly is another. If people don't actually care or don't know how, the whole thing just falls flat (Solsona, 2024). So, basically, this whole project is about looking hard at the money side of ditching plastic for compostable stuff at the Mapúa MCM canteen, checking out the actual environmental win, and figuring out if students will even bother. For us doing this research, it feels pretty relevant because schools should be green, but we gotta be real about how expensive and hard it is to actually make changes.


So, looking around at what other places did helps a bit. Like, that Middlebury place, they figured out that using the compostable stuff could actually make sense financially over time—like, positive NPV, whatever that means (Kaur & Acid, 2020). But then you got Canadian schools saying maybe just washing and reusing stuff forever is better than using any single-use option, even if it’s compostable. It really depends on how many times you use it (Snyder & Park, 2024). Plus, using materials from plants is supposed to be good for the whole green economy thing and lines up with those UN goals, which is cool, I guess. Still, cost and infrastructure are major hurdles (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).


Here in the Philippines, compostable packaging seems promising too, but we gotta check local stuff. One study said biodegradable stuff breaks down in like a month, which is way better than plastic staying forever (Yao et al., 2024). They even have these cool mixes using farm stuff and bioplastics to help the circular economy thing (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). The catch? It’s usually more expensive upfront because of how they make it. But if we save on waste fees later and keep the government happy with green policies, maybe it evens out (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). Down in Zamboanga, they saw less plastic when they switched, but people still complained about the new stuff breaking too easily or just not liking it (Mohammad, 2024). So, for Mapúa MCM, it’s a tightrope walk between wanting to be eco-friendly, staying within budget, and hoping students don't just throw the compostable stuff in the regular trash bin.


To try and sort through all this mess, we’re using two main theories, which sounds super academic but whatever. First is Cost-Benefit Analysis, or CBA. This is just a formal way to compare how much we spend on the fancy new containers versus how much we save on dumping trash, plus the good feeling of helping the environment and looking good as a school (Mishan & Quah, 2020). CBA should tell us if, financially, switching makes sense in the long run, even if the initial packaging costs more.


The other big theory is the Theory of Planned Behavior, or TPB. This one is about people. It basically says what people *intend* to do depends on what they think about it, what their friends are doing, and if they actually feel like they *can* do it (Ajzen, 1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). So, even if the compostable route saves the school a ton of money, if students think it’s inconvenient or just don't care enough, they won't use it right. By mixing CBA (the money side) with TPB (the people side), we can see if the switch is actually doable in the real world here.


Honestly, though, there’s still so much we don’t know, especially for a school in the Philippines. Most of the research is from other countries, which might not fit our budget limits or how our local waste system works here at Mapúa MCM. Like, do we even have proper bins to separate the compostable stuff? And while TPB is a cool framework, not many people have checked how Filipino students and staff actually react to these green drives. We never really ask the canteen vendors what they think, but they’re the ones dealing with ordering, storage, and cost issues every day. Also, people always talk about reusable stuff as the perfect answer, but there isn't much actual comparison research showing if reusable is better than compostable specifically on a busy college campus. We also need to see how much the school's own rules and local city rules play into this mess.


Bottom line, this study is really just trying to figure out if swapping out plastic for compostable containers at the Mapúa MCM canteen is actually realistic. We gotta check out if it’s feasible for the vendors long-term, and really dig into what students and teachers think—their attitudes, if they feel social pressure, and if they feel capable of making the change. If we look at the hard money stuff alongside the social stuff, we should get a much clearer picture on whether this transition is something we can actually afford, if people will accept it, and if it’s going to stick around, which is the whole point of reducing plastic waste on campus.
