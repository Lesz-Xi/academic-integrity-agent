There is a lot of talk lately about how plastic waste harms the environment, and schools are part of the problem. Canteens at universities, like the one at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM), are often criticized for using too many single-use plastics. These items become trash and release greenhouse gases. Some people suggest that switching to compostable food containers could solve this, but swapping plastic for something "eco-friendly" isn't just a simple exchange.



Switching to compostable packaging involves several factors. First is the cost. Compostable materials usually have a higher initial price tag, meaning Mapúa MCM has to decide if lower long-term waste disposal fees justify the expense. Some research indicates it might save money over time, but that upfront spending increase often makes institutions pause.



Then there is the issue of actual user behavior. Even if compostable containers are supplied, will students and staff actually sort and dispose of them correctly? Studies suggest that eco-packaging might encourage better habits, but there is usually a gap between what people say they will do for the environment and their actual actions.



Looking at international examples might help. Schools overseas that have tried compostable service ware have sometimes made a profit in the long run. However, some research shows that reusable systems—like encouraging people to bring their own containers—might be better for both the budget and the environment than single-use compostables. Locally, compostable packaging can break down in about a month, which is good, but it is still pricier and needs specific facilities to handle the waste. Some local tests, such as those in Zamboanga City, show that while switching reduces plastic, problems with cost, durability, and convenience still pop up.



This is where theoretical tools come into play. A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) can be used to calculate whether compostables make financial sense for the Mapúa MCM canteen. At the same time, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) can help predict if students and staff will support and stick with this change. If people find the eco-friendly option inconvenient or simply do not care enough, the whole effort could fail.



In the Philippines, we still lack key information. Most studies about sustainable campus packaging come from other countries that have better waste management infrastructure. Local schools also struggle with poor composting setups and low vendor awareness. Vendors, who are essential, often worry about expense, how strong the products are, and if they can be supplied consistently. While reusable options exist, no one has really compared how practical they are versus compostables specifically on a campus like Mapúa MCM.



Ultimately, this study aims to determine if replacing plastic with compostable packaging in the Mapúa MCM canteen is practical. It requires balancing the school’s finances, the environmental gains, and how people will actually react. If the transition works, the school could cut down on single-use plastics and make a measurable move toward sustainability.
