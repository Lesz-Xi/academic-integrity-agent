The global panic over plastic waste demands immediate action from educational institutions. Campus cafeterias, in particular, generate mountains of single-use plastic that strains waste management and damages the environment. Here at Mapúa MCM, we are exploring the shift from standard plastic serviceware to compostable alternatives, but the logistical and financial questions are immediate headaches. Will this transition actually work? What are the true costs? And do the environmental benefits justify the disruption?

Adopting compostable materials is no simple switch. Administrators must account for the budget, whether the necessary collection bins and hauling infrastructure are in place, and crucially, whether users comply correctly. Some research suggests long-term savings due to reduced landfill fees (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Yet, the initial capital outlay for premium containers is almost always higher. For the Mapúa MCM canteen, this presents a clear trade-off: are the abstract long-term environmental gains worth the immediate fiscal strain and logistical complexity?

Student buy-in is another concern. Surveys indicate that people generally support biodegradable options and express a desire to act greener (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). However, good intentions rarely translate into consistent behavior. If users lack awareness or simply fail to sort materials correctly, the entire system collapses (Solsona, 2024). This project, therefore, focuses on analyzing the financial viability of ditching plastic for compostables at the Mapúa MCM canteen, assessing the measurable environmental gain, and determining the probability of actual student participation. For us conducting this study, the relevance is clear: schools should lead on sustainability, but we must remain realistic about the expense and difficulty of institutional change.

Benchmarking against peer institutions offers some guidance. Middlebury, for example, found that using compostables could be financially positive over the long run, showing a positive Net Present Value (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Contrarily, some Canadian analyses argue that aggressive reuse programs, washing and cycling materials indefinitely, trump any single-use solution, even compostable ones, depending on the usage rate (Snyder & Park, 2024). Plant-based material use does align with broader goals for the green economy and UN directives, which is beneficial. Cost and local infrastructure, however, remain major obstacles (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippine context, compostable packaging shows local promise, though local verification is essential. One study reported biodegradable items decomposing within a month, a major improvement over persistent plastic waste (Yao et al., 2024). Researchers are also developing innovative blends using agricultural waste and bioplastics to boost the circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). The immediate barrier is elevated cost, driven by current manufacturing scaling. If future savings on waste disposal fees and alignment with government green incentives offset this, the switch might balance out (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). A switch in Zamboanga saw a measurable decrease in plastic volume, but users complained about the new containers degrading too quickly or general dissatisfaction (Mohammad, 2024). Mapúa MCM faces this same tightrope walk: balancing environmental aspirations, budgetary discipline, and ensuring students do not simply contaminate the compost stream with regular trash.

To navigate this complexity, we are employing two core theoretical models. The first is Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). This is simply a formal structure to compare the expenditure on new serviceware against the projected savings from reduced waste hauling, factoring in the intangible benefits of institutional reputation and environmental goodwill (Mishan & Quah, 2020). CBA should clarify if the financial merits of the switch exist over the long term, even if initial packaging costs are steep.

The second lens is the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This framework focuses squarely on human action. TPB posits that behavioral intention—whether someone intends to compost correctly—is shaped by their attitude toward the action, subjective social norms (what their peers are doing), and perceived behavioral control (whether they feel capable of doing it right) (Ajzen, 1991, cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). Thus, even if the compostable route is sound for the institution's bottom line, if students find it inconvenient or simply do not prioritize it, participation will fail. Integrating CBA (the money) with TPB (the people) offers a necessary real-world feasibility assessment.

However, significant unknowns persist, especially concerning local Philippine conditions. Much of the existing research originates abroad, which may not translate to our specific budget constraints or Mapúa MCM’s waste management reality. Do we even possess the correct segregation bins? While TPB is a robust framework, few studies examine how Filipino students and staff react specifically to campus-wide green initiatives. Canteen vendors, who manage ordering, storage, and immediate cost pressures daily, remain largely unconsulted. Furthermore, while reusable systems are often touted as the ideal, there is a scarcity of direct comparative research demonstrating whether reusables outperform compostables in a high-volume college setting. Local municipal ordinances and school policies also add layers of complexity.

This study ultimately seeks to determine the practical feasibility of replacing plastic with compostable containers at Mapúa MCM. We must investigate long-term vendor viability and deeply analyze the attitudes of students and faculty—their beliefs, social pressures, and perceived ability to comply. By examining the hard financial data alongside the social psychology, we should gain a clear picture of whether this transition is affordable, acceptable to the user base, and, most importantly, sustainable over time.
