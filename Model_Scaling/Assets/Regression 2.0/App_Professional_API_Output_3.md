The transition to sustainable practices in campus cafeterias is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Institutions must carefully consider the financial implications, logistical requirements, and the extent of student engagement to ensure the success of such initiatives.

The adoption of compostable containers in lieu of single-use plastics is not a simple solution. Institutions must assess the budgetary impact, as the upfront costs for the compostable alternatives are often significantly higher (Kaur & Acid, 2020). Furthermore, the availability of the necessary infrastructure, such as composting bins and waste management services, must be evaluated.

A critical factor in the success of this endeavor is student participation. While the concept of biodegradable materials may be appealing, the actual implementation requires students to actively engage in proper disposal and washing practices (Giordano & Mariani, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025). If students do not embrace the changes, the environmental benefits may not be realized (Solsona, 2024).

The decision to transition to compostable containers in campus cafeterias is not one to be taken lightly. Institutions must conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis, assess the logistical feasibility, and develop strategies to foster student involvement. The long-term environmental benefits must be weighed against the short-term financial and operational challenges. Ultimately, the success of such initiatives will depend on the careful planning and execution of a comprehensive sustainability strategy.


Middlebury institution has discovered that utilizing compostable materials can generate positive net present value over time (Kaur & Acid, 2020). However, Canadian schools have suggested that perpetually washing and reusing items may be more advantageous than any single-use option, even compostable ones, depending on the number of times the items are used (Snyder & Park, 2024). Moreover, the utilization of plant-based materials aligns with the United Nations' sustainability goals, which is a favorable outcome. Nevertheless, cost and infrastructure remain significant obstacles (Ikechukwu, 2024; Daramola et al., 2025).

In the Philippines, compostable packaging also exhibits promise, but local conditions must be examined. One study indicated that biodegradable materials decompose within a month, which is considerably better than plastic's perpetual existence (Yao et al., 2024). Additionally, innovative blends of agricultural waste and bioplastics have been developed to aid the circular economy (Giordano & Mariani, 2024). The caveat is that these materials are typically more expensive upfront due to their production process. However, if waste disposal fees are reduced and government green policies are satisfied, the costs may be balanced out (Yao et al., 2024; Ikechukwu, 2024). In Zamboanga, the switch to compostable alternatives resulted in less plastic waste, but users complained about the new materials' fragility and lack of appeal (Mohammad, 2024). For Mapúa MCM, it is a delicate balance between environmental consciousness, budgetary constraints, and student acceptance.

To navigate this complex landscape, two primary theories are being employed. The first is Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), which formally compares the expenditures on the new, eco-friendly containers against the savings from reduced waste disposal, along with the intangible benefits of environmental stewardship and institutional reputation (Mishan & Quah, 2020). The CBA should indicate whether the switch to compostable packaging makes financial sense in the long run, even if the initial costs are higher.


The Theory of Planned Behavior, or TPB, is another prominent theory. This framework suggests that an individual's intended behavior depends on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (Ajzen, 1991, as cited in Sarmah & Singh, 2024). Even if the compostable option saves the institution substantial funds, if students perceive it as inconvenient or lack the motivation, they may not adopt the practice. By integrating cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and TPB, the feasibility of the switch can be assessed within the real-world context.

However, there remains significant uncertainty, especially in the context of a school in the Philippines. Much of the existing research originates from other countries, which may not align with the budgetary constraints or local waste management infrastructure at Mapúa MCM. The availability of proper waste segregation bins, for instance, is unclear. Additionally, while TPB provides a valuable theoretical framework, limited empirical evidence exists regarding the reactions of Filipino students and staff to such sustainability initiatives. The perspectives of canteen vendors, who grapple with ordering, storage, and cost implications daily, are often overlooked. Furthermore, the comparative effectiveness of reusable versus compostable alternatives in a busy college campus setting requires further investigation.

Ultimately, this study aims to determine the realistic viability of transitioning from plastic to compostable containers at the Mapúa MCM canteen. It is crucial to examine the long-term feasibility for vendors, as well as to deeply understand the attitudes, social influences, and perceived capabilities of students and faculty. By holistically considering the financial and social factors, a more comprehensive evaluation of the transition's sustainability can be achieved.
