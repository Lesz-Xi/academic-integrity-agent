Looking at this section, I need to humanize the overly formal academic language while maintaining the core content and methodology. Let me restructure this with more natural academic writing patterns.

This study employs a quantitative descriptive-survey research design to examine staff perspectives on transitioning from plastic to compostable packaging. A descriptive survey, as Apuke (2021) explains, systematically gathers data from a specific group through questionnaires or structured interviews to quantify opinions, behaviors, or perceptions about particular issues. This approach fits our research goals perfectly—we need measurable insights into canteen staff attitudes, perceived challenges, and cost-related concerns regarding the packaging shift.

Why quantitative? The decision stems from practical necessity. We're conducting a cost-benefit analysis, which demands structured, numerical data that can reveal patterns and trends statistically (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Rather than exploring broad themes or personal narratives, this study focuses on specific, measurable indicators: cost efficiency, operational feasibility, and perceived environmental benefits. These elements require objective data collection and analysis to produce reliable conclusions (Kenton, 2021).

The descriptive-survey design aligns naturally with our theoretical foundation—Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour. The TPB examines how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence decision-making processes. Applying this framework allows us to capture how canteen staff actually perceive the practicality and challenges of transitioning to compostable packaging, particularly regarding financial implications and daily operational changes.

But why focus specifically on canteen staff? Their perspectives matter most because they handle food preparation, packaging, and service daily. Unlike administrators or students who might have theoretical opinions, these staff members possess firsthand knowledge of costs, workload adjustments, and feasibility issues associated with replacing plastic packaging. They understand storage requirements, handling procedures, and waste management realities—knowledge that's crucial for assessing whether this transition makes practical sense.

The Mapúa MCM setting provides contextual relevance since the canteen generates significant campus waste. Understanding staff perspectives ensures our data reflects real operational knowledge rather than abstract speculation. These individuals deal with packaging decisions constantly, making their insights invaluable for determining whether compostable alternatives can work effectively in this environment.

One might question whether staff opinions alone sufficiently address cost-benefit analysis. However, frontline workers often recognize operational challenges and potential solutions that escape management attention. Their daily experience with packaging materials, customer interactions, and waste handling provides grounded insights that complement financial projections and environmental assessments.

This methodological approach acknowledges that successful sustainability transitions depend not just on policy decisions but on practical implementation by those directly involved. The descriptive-survey design captures these implementation realities while maintaining the quantitative rigor necessary for meaningful cost-benefit evaluation.
