The methodology chosen hinges on a quantitative descriptive-survey approach. As Apuke (2021) explains, this kind of survey gathers measurable data—opinions, actions, or viewpoints—from a specific group using structured tools like interviews or questionnaires about a focused subject. This design fits well since the objective involves measuring canteen staff attitudes, the practical obstacles, and the budgetary concerns they face when contemplating swapping plastic for compostable packaging.

Choosing a quantitative method makes sense. The investigation requires numerical proof so that statistical analysis can identify patterns in how participants responded (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Objectivity gets maintained during data collection and assessment by focusing strictly on things we can count, such as expense administration, the ease of daily operations, and the perceived ecological gains. Also, this setup directly feeds the cost-benefit assessment, which is the study’s core element, demanding strictly measurable data (Kenton, 2021).

This descriptive survey structure links neatly to Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), which guides the entire study. TPB focuses on how personal attitudes, what others think (subjective norms), and a person’s perceived control over an action shape their ultimate choices. Applying this framework lets us capture the staff’s views on how difficult or realistic it is to shift from plastic to compostable materials, especially regarding workflow changes and budget implications.

Conducting this study specifically at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM) provides essential contextual grounding; the canteen generates a significant portion of campus waste. We need the staff’s firsthand view—the people packing, serving, and handling food daily. This guarantees the figures collected accurately represent real-world feasibility issues, workload adjustments, and the true monetary costs associated with abandoning standard plastic containers.
