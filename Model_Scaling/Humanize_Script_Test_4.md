The research employs a quantitative descriptive-survey structure. Apuke (2021) describes a descriptive survey as a process for gathering data from selected groups through structured interviews or questionnaires; this method captures measurable behaviors, opinions, or perceptions about the specific subject matter. This design fits the objectives perfectly, since the main aim involves quantifying the staff's attitudes, financial constraints, and practical challenges related to moving away from plastic packaging toward compostable alternatives in the canteen setting.

Using a quantitative approach makes sense. The study requires numerical data to support statistical analysis, which helps reveal patterns within the responses provided by participants (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Maintaining objectivity during data collection and evaluation stems from focusing squarely on measurable factors, like perceived environmental benefits, expense tracking, and operational ease. Furthermore, this setup directly enables the cost-benefit assessment crucial to the investigation, an evaluation demanding strictly measurable figures (Kenton, 2021).

This descriptive-survey setup aligns neatly with the guiding theoretical structure: Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The TPB focuses on how three factors—individual attitudes, the perceived influence of peers (subjective norms), and perceived behavioral control—influence subsequent choices and actions. Applying this framework helps capture staff viewpoints regarding the perceived difficulty and overall viability of replacing plastic ware with compostable items, particularly regarding budgeting and workflow adjustments.

Selecting Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao (Mapúa MCM) as the site grounds the study in relevant local context; the canteen generates a substantial portion of the campus's waste output. Securing perspectives directly from the canteen employees—the people handling service, packing, and food preparation—ensures the resulting data accurately represents lived realities concerning workload shifts, actual expenses associated with the transition, and feasibility problems encountered when ditching conventional plastic containers.
