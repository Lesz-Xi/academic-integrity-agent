Accidental Chemical Debridement of Pharyngeal Gonorrhea via Calcium Oxalate Toxicity: A Case Report
ABSTRACT
We report a rare toxicological event associated with abrupt resolution of refractory pharyngeal Neisseria gonorrhoeae following inadvertent ingestion of a Dieffenbachia (Araceae) leaf decoction administered nearly simultaneously with high-dose azithromycin (2 g)3. Within 12 hours, the patient expectorated a green membranous slough from the oropharynx with immediate symptom resolution4. A pharmacokinetic exclusion analysis indicates that azithromycin could not plausibly have achieved bactericidal activity within a mature pharyngeal biofilm by 12 hours post-dose5. The most parsimonious mechanism is mechanical debridement of the mucosal biofilm by insoluble calcium oxalate raphides acting as chemical microneedles, followed by antibiotic “clean-up” of residual organisms6. Literature is adduced on pharyngeal gonococcal colonization/biofilms, Araceae raphide injury mechanisms, and azithromycin pharmacokinetics, supporting this interpretation7.
 
1. INTRODUCTION
Pharyngeal gonorrhea remains difficult to eradicate due to complex oropharyngeal anatomy, epithelial attachment, and biofilm-associated tolerance to antimicrobials8. Clinical and microbiological studies confirm that N. gonorrhoeae colonizes the tonsils and posterior oropharynx, and biofilm formation is implicated in persistence and treatment failure at this site9. Therapies with demonstrable efficacy at urogenital sites often perform suboptimally in the oropharynx10. We present a unique case in which a toxicological exposure precipitated abrupt mucosal sloughing and clinical cure temporally incompatible with an azithromycin-only mechanism11.
 
2. CASE PRESENTATION
2.1 Patient History and Diagnosis
A male patient presented after high-risk sexual exposure (receptive oral intercourse) with concurrent urethral and pharyngeal symptoms consistent with gonorrhea12:
•	Urethral: Dysuria and thick purulent urethral discharge13.
•	Pharyngeal: Sore throat with exudative whitish plaques on the tonsillar pillars14.
2.2 The Exposure and Timeline
•	Therapeutic Intervention: On Day 6 of the infection, the patient administered 2 g of Azithromycin15.
•	Toxicological Exposure: Simultaneously (within 15 minutes), the patient unknowingly ingested a boiled decoction of Dieffenbachia seguine leaves, mistaken for Piper betle16.
•	Thermal Stability: Boiling (100°C) did not neutralize the calcium oxalate raphides, which are thermally stable above 400°C17.
2.3 Clinical Findings
•	T+0: Immediate onset of laryngeal edema and mucosal irritation (Grade 2 Toxicity)18.
•	T+12h (The "Purge Event"): Massive expulsion of "green membranous slough" (distinct from liquid pus)19.
•	Outcome: Immediate transition to sterile white sputum and rapid resolution of all pharyngeal symptoms20. Urethral symptoms resolved concurrently, likely due to the antibiotic effect21.
 
3. DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT & FORENSIC ANALYSIS
The central diagnostic question concerns a pharmacological cure (antibiotic) versus a mechanical cure (plant injury)22. The simultaneity of exposures allows for a pharmacokinetic exclusion analysis23.
3.1 Pharmacokinetic Exclusion of Antibiotic Hypothesis
Azithromycin exhibits an oral $T_{max}$ of approximately 2–3 hours, extensive intracellular accumulation, and high distribution to oral tissues24:
•	Saliva:Plasma Ratio: $\approx 6$25.
•	Gingiva:Plasma Ratio: $17–31$26.
•	Tonsil:Plasma Ratio: $\approx 150$27.
Despite these levels, clinical trials show azithromycin-containing regimens have suboptimal pharyngeal cure rates (~80%)—far lower than urethral outcomes—highlighting the difficulty of pharyngeal clearance28. Azithromycin’s slow, concentration-dependent killing and intracellular profile raise concern for prolonged subinhibitory exposure rather than rapid bulk sloughing within 12 hours29. Thus, it is pharmacokinetically implausible that azithromycin alone eradicated a mature pharyngeal biofilm and produced gross membranous sloughing by T+12 h30.
 
4. MECHANISTIC INTERPRETATION
4.1 “Scorched Earth Debridement” by Raphide Microneedles
Araceae raphides are rigid, needle-shaped calcium oxalate crystals stored in specialized cells called idioblasts31. Upon tissue damage, they are ejected and embed into the contacting mucosa, producing immediate intense pain and local edema32.
Toxicology reports describe severe mucosal erosions and necrosis consistent with direct crystal-mediated microtrauma33. Heating can attenuate protease-driven histaminergic reactions, but ulcerative/necrotic injury persists due to the thermal resilience and mechanical action of the crystals34. Substantial fractions of insoluble calcium oxalate persist after routine boiling unless prolonged processing is used35.
4.2 Plausible Sequence of Events
1.  **Mechanical Breach:** Ingestion of raphide-laden decoction deposited abundant insoluble crystals that punctured the superficial biofilm and epithelial layer.
2.  **Enzymatic Synergism:** The plant sap released Cysteine Proteases (e.g., Dumbcain), which likely targeted the exposed hypervariable loops of Gonococcal Opa proteins, enzymatically cleaving the integrity of the biofilm matrix ("Enzymatic Debridement")\cite{degrade_protein}.
3.  **Mucosal Sloughing:** The mechanically injured, devitalized mucosa separated as a green membranous slough at $\approx 12$ h.
4.  **Pathogen Eviction:** The biofilm and adherent \textit{N. gonorrhoeae} were physically removed with the sloughed layer, leading to immediate symptom resolution.
5.  **Antibiotic ``Cleanup'':** Exposure of the denuded wound bed likely increased the access of circulating azithromycin to residual organisms, preventing recolonization.
 
5. CONTEXT & LIMITATIONS
5.1 Pharyngeal Gonorrhea and Biofilms
•	Reservoirs: N. gonorrhoeae is detected in tonsils and can be cultured from saliva, suggesting a reservoir that complicates eradication40.
•	Biofilms: Evidence implicates gonococcal biofilms in pathogenesis and treatment failures, including with topical antiseptics41.
•	PK Limitations: Azithromycin's slow activity and recognized suboptimal pharyngeal cure rates indicate that a 12-hour timeline to gross debridement is inconsistent with an antibiotic-only effect42.
5.2 Limitations
Microbiological confirmation of organism clearance immediately before and after the purge event was not available43. Nevertheless, convergent pharmacokinetic evidence and the characteristic toxicological phenotype of Araceae raphide injury support this interpretation44.
 
6. CONCLUSION
This case illustrates an iatrogenic-like cure mediated by toxicological microneedling and superficial mucosal debridement from calcium oxalate raphides, temporally incompatible with an azithromycin-only mechanism45. The pharmacokinetic exclusion of azithromycin as the proximate driver supports a mechanism of “scorched earth debridement,” with subsequent antibiotic consolidation of cure46. This event is a toxicological anomaly and not a therapeutic recommendation47.
