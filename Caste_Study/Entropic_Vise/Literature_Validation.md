We investigated whether Shannon information entropy has been explicitly mapped to structural stability and thermodynamic constraints in HIV-1 Env (gp120/gp41), and whether any work defines an “entropic cost” that creates fitness valleys or a formal thermodynamic floor (“Entropic Vise”).

Evidence linking entropy metrics to Env constraints: Deep mutational scanning (DMS) studies of Env estimate per-site amino-acid preferences and summarize site mutational tolerance using Shannon entropy. After adjusting for structural covariates such as relative solvent accessibility and RNA constraints, broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes exhibit significantly reduced mutational tolerance (lower entropy), indicating strong functional constraints in these regions. These studies show good correspondence between experimentally inferred preferences and natural sequence frequencies, suggesting that low-entropy regions reflect inherent fitness penalties to mutation rather than solely external selection. However, these works use entropy as a statistical descriptor of mutational tolerance and do not compute thermodynamic free energies or entropic costs in physical units (e.g., kcal/mol·K). (1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2)

Structural stability–focused evidence: Independent structure-based mappings of sequence variability onto Env structures show that buried/core residues have markedly lower variability (lower entropy) than surface residues, consistent with structural stability constraints shaping evolutionary tolerability. This provides a structural rationale for entropy–constraint correlations but does not constitute a thermodynamic proof of non-mutability. (4.1)

Conformational/energetic landscape insights: DMS selections performed with conformation-specific probes (e.g., CD4 vs. PG16) identify sequence features that stabilize closed versus open trimer states, with mechanistic interpretations invoking electrostatic repulsion at the apex and hydrophobic packing at the inner–outer domain interface. These data delineate regions where mutations shift conformational equilibria and reduce “breathing,” implying stability constraints on the trimer. Nonetheless, they stop short of deriving entropic costs or proving near-zero mutational probabilities due to inevitable structural collapse. (5.1, 6.1)

Conclusion regarding a thermodynamic floor/“Entropic Vise”: Across the reviewed evidence, Shannon entropy has been widely used to quantify mutational tolerance in Env and correlates with structural constraints, but we did not find a formal thermodynamic derivation of an “entropic cost” that establishes a proof of a thermodynamic floor rendering specific Env regions non-mutable. Studies identify strongly constrained, low-entropy, low-tolerance regions consistent with deep fitness penalties, but no work provides a mathematical proof of near-zero mutational probability arising from unavoidable structural collapse of the Env trimer. Therefore, the theoretical basis for an “Entropic Vise,” in the strict thermodynamic sense, remains an open objective; existing results provide empirical entropy–constraint mappings and mechanistic rationales rather than formal thermodynamic proofs.
