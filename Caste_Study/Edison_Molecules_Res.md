Molecular Stability of Cysteine Proteases at Physiological pH (7.4)
Cysteine proteases like papain and dumbcain exhibit substantial molecular stability at physiological pH (7.4). Key findings about their stability include:

They maintain structural stability across a broad pH range, including physiological pH
Their kinetic pH profiles are bell-shaped with apparent pKas near ~4 and ~8–8.5, indicating significant catalytic activity at neutral pH
The catalytic Cys25 residue has a pKa of approximately 3.3, meaning it exists primarily in its deprotonated, active thiolate form at pH 7.4
This ionization state supports enzymatic activity at physiological pH
Autodigestion Potential
The potential for cysteine proteases to autodigest depends on several factors:

In isolation under standard experimental conditions (25°C), papain shows minimal autodigestion over short timeframes
However, in specific interactions (such as with antithrombin), papain can undergo autolytic degradation
Related cysteine proteases like bromelain demonstrate substantial autodigestive loss of activity during storage at physiological temperature (37°C)
This indicates that self-proteolysis can be significant for cysteine proteases under physiological conditions if not properly protected
Effect of Lipid Nanoparticle Encapsulation
Encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles has protective effects for cysteine proteases:

Liposomes and transferosomes can achieve high loading of papain and retain approximately 72–79% of enzymatic activity after formulation and lyophilization
For related enzymes, nanoparticle association reduced autodigestive loss during storage
Lipid nanoparticle formulation does not denature papain and can mitigate adverse tissue effects
The research supports a protective effect of encapsulation against self-digestion
Would Cysteine Proteases Autodigest if Encapsulated in Lipid Nanoparticles?
Based on the available evidence, cysteine proteases would be largely protected from autodigestion when encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles at physiological pH (7.4). The encapsulation provides a protective environment that helps maintain enzyme stability and significantly reduces autodigestion potential, while still allowing the enzymes to retain most of their catalytic activity. This makes lipid nanoparticle formulations a promising approach for utilizing cysteine proteases in physiological environments where autodigestion might otherwise occur.
